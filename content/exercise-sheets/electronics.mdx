1. Give a definition of electronics?

   <Solution>
     The word electronics describes both the field of study that focuses on the
     control of electrical energy and the physical systems (including circuits,
     components, and interconnections) that implement this control of electrical
     energy.
   </Solution>

2. What is electrical charge?

   <Solution>
     Electric charge is a property of certain particles, such as electrons,
     protons, and quarks that describes how they interact with each other. There
     are two different types of electric charge, somewhat arbitrarily named
     positive and negative. In general, particles carrying the same type of
     charge repel each other, whereas particles carrying opposite charges
     attract each other. Within each atom, the protons inside the nucleus
     attract the electrons that are outside the nucleus.
   </Solution>

3. What is electrical energy?
   <Solution>
     A form of energy caused by the behavior of electrically charged particles.
     This is what you pay your electric company to supply.
   </Solution>
4. What is electrical current?
   <Solution>
     Electric current (often called electricity) is the displacement of a large
     number of electrons in the same direction through a conductor when an
     external force (or push) is applied.
   </Solution>
5. Give and define the three main subatomic particles?

   <Solution>

   - **Protons** carry a positive electric charge and exist inside the
     _nucleus_, or center, of the atom.
   - **Neutrons** have no electric charge, and exist along with protons inside
     the nucleus.
   - **Electrons** carry a negative electric charge and are located outside the
     nucleus in an _electron cloud_. Some are closer to the nucleus than others.

   </Solution>

6. Under normal circumstances, every atom has an equal number of protons and
   electrons. Which expression is used to describe that state?

   <Solution>The atom is said to be electrically neutral.</Solution>

7. What is the main characteristic of materials called electrical conductors?

   <Solution>
     Electrical conductors are materials containing loosely bound outer
     electrons.
   </Solution>

8. What is the main characteristic of materials called electrical insulators?

   <Solution>
     Electrical insulators are materials that tend to keep their electrons close
     to home.
   </Solution>

9. What is the measure is used to quantify the strength of an electric current.
   Give a precise definition.

   <Solution>

   The strength of an electric current is defined by how many charge carriers
   (usually electrons) pass a fixed point in one second, and is measured in
   units called amperes, or amps (abbreviated as A). One ampere is defined to be
   $6.241 \times 10^{18}$ electrons per second. The symbol $I$ is used to
   represent the strength of an electric current.

   </Solution>

10. What is a coulomb?

    <Solution>

    The term _coulomb_ is used to describe the magnitude of the charge carried
    by $6.241 \times 10^{18}$ electrons. A coulomb is related to an amp in that
    one coulomb is the amount of charge carried by one amp of current in one
    second.

    </Solution>

11. What are the different names given to the force that pushes electrons along,
    and which measure is used to quantify that force?

    <Solution>

    The force that pushes electrons along is technically called an electromotive
    force (abbreviated EMF or $E$), but it is more commonly known as voltage
    (abbreviated $V$). You measure voltage by using units called (conveniently)
    volts (abbreviated V).

    </Solution>

12. Explain simply what a voltage is through the example of the battery.

    <Solution>

    A _voltage_ is simply a difference in electrical charge between two points.
    In a battery, negatively charged atoms (atoms with an abundance of
    electrons) build up on one of two metal plates, and positively charged atoms
    (atoms with a dearth of electrons) build up on the other metal plate,
    creating a voltage across the plates. If you provide a conductive path
    between the metal plates, you enable excess electrons to travel from one
    plate to the other, and current will flow in an effort to neutralize the
    charges. The electromotive force that compels current to flow when the
    circuit is completed is created by the difference between charges at the
    battery terminals.

    You may also hear the terms _potential difference_, _voltage potential_,
    _potential drop_, or _voltage drop_ used to describe voltage. The word
    _potential_ refers to the possibility that a current may flow if you
    complete the circuit, and the words _drop_ and _difference_ both refer to
    the difference in charge that creates the voltage.
