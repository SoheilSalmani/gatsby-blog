1. Get the SHA1 of "Hello, World!" using Git.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   echo 'Hello, World!' | git hash-object --stdin
   ```

   </Solution>

2. Try to get the same SHA1 using `openssl`.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   printf 'blob 14\0Hello, World!\n' | openssl sha1
   ```

   </Solution>

3. Save a blob with "Hello, World!" as content using Git.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   echo 'Hello, World!' | git hash-object -w --stdin
   ```

   </Solution>

4. List (as a tree) the contents of the `.git` directory.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   tree .git
   ```

   </Solution>

5. Create the following structure and commit it.

   <Figure src="/media/git-identical-content.png">
     Identical content is only stored one!
   </Figure>

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   echo "Hello World!" > hello.txt
   mkdir copies
   echo "Hello World!" > hello-copy.txt
   ```

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   </Solution>

6. Inspect all Git objects (type and content).

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   tree .git
   ```

   Use:

   ```shell
   git cat-file -t [sha1]
   git cat-file -p [sha1]
   ```

   </Solution>

7. Inspect all references and see if you can figure out where these references
   are pointing to.

   <Solution>

   Let's look under the hood at our `HEAD` variable. `HEAD` is just git's
   pointer to "where you are now," usually referring to the current branch. We
   can see that right now, it points to our current branch - `master`.

   Now, if we look at our `master` reference, we can see that it points to the
   latest commit.

   ```shell
   cat .git/HEAD
   cat .git/refs/heads/master
   ```

   </Solution>

8. Configure the editor that Git should use (test with VSCode and Vim).

   <Solution>

   Vim:

   ```shell
   git config --global core.editor vim
   ```

   VSCode:

   ```shell
   git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
   ```

   </Solution>

   previous page.

   <Solution>

   To navigate:

   - <Kbd>F</Kbd>, for next page
   - <Kbd>B</Kbd>, for previous page

   </Solution>

10. Search a word in `less`, select the next match and then the previous match.

    <Solution>

    To search:

    - <Kbd>/&lt;query&gt;</Kbd>
    - <Kbd>N</Kbd>, for next match
    - <Kbd>P</Kbd>, for previous match

    </Solution>

11. Quit less.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout -- <file_path>
    ```

    </Solution>

57. Overwrite a working area file with the version of an old commit. The change
    should be staged, and you have to do it all in one command.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout <commit> -- <file_path>
    ```

    </Solution>

58. Find a commit where a file was deleted, and restore it in the working area.
    The restored file should be staged, and you have to do it all in one

    ```

    </Solution>

62. Reset from a previous commit by just moving HEAD.

    <Solution>

    ```shell

    ```

    </Solution>

63. Reset from a previous commit by moving HEAD and copying files to the staging
    area.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git reset --mixed HEAD~
    git reset HEAD~
    ```

    </Solution>

64. Reset from a previous commit by moving HEAD and copying files to the staging
    and working area.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git reset --hard HEAD~
    ```

    </Solution>

65. Reset a file in the staging area to the version of the last commit.

    <Solution>

    <Solution>

    ```shell

    ```

    </Solution>

70. Rebase a branch to begin on the tip of the master branch.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout <branch_to_rebase>
    git rebase master
    ```

    </Solution>

71. Perform an interactive rebase and use all the rebase options.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git rebase -i <first-commit>^
    ```

    The rebase options are:

    - `pick`: keep the commit.
    - `reword`: keep the commit, just change the message.
    - `edit`: keep the commit, but stop to edit more than the message.
    - `squash`: combine the commit with the previous one, then stop to edit the
      message.
    - `fixup`: combine the commit with the previous one, but keep the previous
      commit message.
    - `exec`: run the command on this line after picking the previous commit.
    - `drop`: remove the commit (**tip:** if you remove this line, the commit
      will be dropped too!).

    </Solution>

72. Use an interactive rebase to split a commit.

    <Solution>

    Editing a commit can also split it up into multiple commits!

    1. Start an interactive rebase with `rebase -i`.
    2. Mark the commit with an `edit`.
    3. `git reset HEAD^`
    4. `git add`
    5. `git commit`
    6. Repeat 4. and 5. until the working area is clean!
    7. `git rebase --continue`

    </Solution>

73. Use the _Fixup and Autosquash_ feature of Git.

    <Solution>

    What if we want to amend an arbitrary commit?

    1. `git add` new files.
    2. `git commit --fixup <commit>`: this creates a new commit, the message
       starts with "fixup!".
    3. `git rebase -i --autosquash <commit>^`.
    4. git will generate the right todos for you! Just save and quit.

    Git will automatically reorder commits, and mark the commit with fixup
    action.

    </Solution>

74. Configure an interactive rebase to run a command after every commit in the
    list.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git rebase -i --exec "run-tests" <commit>
    ```

    </Solution>

75. Abort a rebase.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git rebase --abort
    ```

    </Solution>

76. Create a backup of your branch, then perform an interactive rebase. The
    rebase "succeeds" but you messed up, so reset to the backup branch.

    <Solution>

    Before your rebase/ fixup / squash / reorder:

    1. Make a copy of your current branch: `git branch my_branch_backup`.
    2. If rebase "succeeds" but you messed up...

       ```shell
       git reset my_branch_backup --hard
       ```

    3. You're back in business!

    </Solution>

77. Create an organization on GitHub, create a repository inside it and clone
    the repo. Add some commits, push them, then fork the repo in your personal
    space. Rename the `origin` remote to `upstream`, and add the new remote (the
    fork of the repo) as `origin`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git remote rename origin upstream
    git remote add origin git@github.com:mhenstell/advanced-git-exercises.git
    ```

    </Solution>

78. List all remotes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git remote -v
    ```

    </Solution>

79. Set up `master` to track `origin/master`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout master
    git branch --set-upstream-to origin/master
    ```

    </Solution>

80. Add commits to `master` in the organization repo, then create a `feature`
    branch in our forked one. Pull the changes from `upstream/master` and create
    a merge commit in the feature branch.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout feature
    git pull upstream master
    ```

    </Solution>

81. Same but this time, rebase the `feature` branch instead of creating a merge
    commit. You have to do it all in one command.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout feature
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    ```

    </Solution>

82. Push the `feature` branch to `origin`. It should tracks the remote branch.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git push -u origin feature
    ```

    </Solution>

83. Delete the master branch, then checkout a remote branch with tracking.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git checkout -t upstream/master
    ```

    </Solution>

84. Add new commits, then list all commits which haven't been pushed upstream
    yet.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git cherry -v
    ```

    </Solution>

85. Create tags, push one of them, then push all of them.

    <Solution>

    To push tags:

    - `git push <tagname>`
    - `git push --tags`

    </Solution>

86. Properly undo a merge.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD
    ```

    </Solution>

87. Perform a rebase and undo it with the help of reflogs. Of course, don't use
    a backup branch.

    <Solution>

    Use:

    ```shell
    git reflog
    ```

    </Solution>

88. Get a list of shortcuts in GitHub (using a shortcut).

    curl https://api.github.com/users/SoheilSalmani
    ```

    </Solution>

100. Create a personal access token, then use it to make a cURL request.

     <Solution>

     1. Visit <Scr>Settings | Developer settings | Personal access tokens</Scr>.
     2. Click <Scr>Generate new token</Scr>.
     3. Enter a token description.
     4. Select the "repo" scope, leave all others unchecked.
     5. Store the access code in a safe place, you won't be able to retrieve it
        again. If you lose it, you'll have to generate a new one.

     ```shell
     curl -i -H 'Authorization: token <YOUR_TOKEN>' https://api.github.com/user
     ```

     </Solution>

Don't forget to delete the GitHub organization, repositories and tokens.
