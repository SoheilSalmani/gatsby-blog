1. Get the SHA1 of "Hello, World!" using Git.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   echo 'Hello, World!' | git hash-object --stdin
   ```

   </Solution>

2. Try to get the same SHA1 using `openssl`.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   printf 'blob 14\0Hello, World!\n' | openssl sha1
   ```

   </Solution>

3. Save a blob with "Hello, World!" as content using Git.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   echo 'Hello, World!' | git hash-object -w --stdin
   ```

   </Solution>

4. List (as a tree) the contents of the `.git` directory.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   tree .git
   ```

   </Solution>

5. Create the following structure and commit it.

   <Figure src="/media/git-identical-content.png">
     Identical content is only stored one!
   </Figure>

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   echo "Hello World!" > hello.txt
   mkdir copies
   echo "Hello World!" > hello-copy.txt
   ```

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   </Solution>

6. Inspect all Git objects (type and content).

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   tree .git
   ```

   Use:

   ```shell
   git cat-file -t [sha1]
   git cat-file -p [sha1]
   ```

   </Solution>

7. Inspect all references.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   git log --oneline
   cat .git/refs/heads/master
   cat .git/HEAD
   ```

   </Solution>

8. Configure the editor that Git should use (test with VSCode and Vim).

   <Solution>

   Vim:

   ```shell
   git config --global core.editor vim
   ```

   VSCode:

   ```shell
   git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
   ```

   </Solution>

9. Create a new folder and initialize it as a Git repo.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   git status
   git identical
   ```

   </Solution>

10. Create a file, stage it, and commit it to your new repo.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    echo 'Hello World!' > hello.txt
    git add hello.txt
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    </Solution>

11. Look at your `.git` folder, using tree if you have it.

    <Solution>

    Using tree, look in your .git/objects folder, you should now see three
    objects, represented by long SHA1 hashes. These represent the tree, blob,
    and commit that we created in the last step.

    ```shell
    tree .git
    ```

    </Solution>

12. Inspect the objects in your `.git/objects` folder using `git cat-file`. See
    if you can find the tree, blob, and commit objects for your recent commit.

    <Solution>

    Use:

    ```shell
    git cat-file -t [sha1]
    git cat-file -p [sha1]
    ```

    </Solution>

13. Look at your `.git/HEAD` and `.git/refs/heads/master` files and see if you
    can figure out where these references are pointing to.

    <Solution>

    Let's look under the hood at our `HEAD` variable. `HEAD` is just git's
    pointer to "where you are now," usually referring to the current branch. We
    can see that right now, it points to our current branch - `master`.

    Now, if we look at our `master` reference, we can see that it points to the
    latest commit.

    ```shell
    cat .git/HEAD
    cat .git/refs/heads/master
    ```

    </Solution>

14. Open something with `less`, go to the next page and then return to the
    previous page.

    <Solution>

    To navigate:

    - <Kbd>F</Kbd>, for next page
    - <Kbd>B</Kbd>, for previous page

    </Solution>

15. Search a word in `less`, select the next match and then the previous match.

    <Solution>

    To search:

    - <Kbd>/&lt;query&gt;</Kbd>
    - <Kbd>N</Kbd>, for next match
    - <Kbd>P</Kbd>, for previous match

    </Solution>

16. Quit less.

    <Solution>

    To quit:

    - <Kbd>Q</Kbd>, to quit

    </Solution>
