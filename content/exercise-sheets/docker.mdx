1. A single Docker image can be used on any Docker host, regardless of the
   architecture used.

   - A. True
   - B. False

   <Solution>
     (B) False. A container that is based on one architecture cannot be run on a
     different architecture. For example, an image created using the x86
     architecture will not run on an ARM-based architecture.
   </Solution>

2. What does Docker use to merge multiple image layers into a single filesystem?

   - A. Merged filesystem
   - B. NTFS filesystem
   - C. EXT4 filesystem
   - D. Union filesystem

   <Solution>
     (D) Union filesystem. Docker uses the Union filesystem to manage multiple
     image layers. The layers are read from top to bottom to provide the
     appearance of a single filesystem.
   </Solution>

3. What is the most commonly used Docker storage driver when using a Kernel that
   is above version 4.0?

   - A. AUFS
   - B. ZFS
   - C. VFS
   - D. Overlay2

   <Solution>
     (D) Overlay2. A system running a kernel that's version 4.0 or above will
     use the Overlay2 storage driver.
   </Solution>

4. When you edit a container's filesystem interactively, what layer are the
   changes written to?

   - A. Operating system layer
   - B. Bottom-most layer
   - C. Container layer
   - D. Ephemeral layer

   <Solution>
     (C) Container layer. Any changes that are made to a running container's
     filesystem are stored in the topmost layer, called the container layer.
   </Solution>

5. Assuming the image contains the required binaries, what Docker command allows
   you to gain access to a container's bash prompt?

   - A. `docker shell -it <container> /bin/bash`
   - B. `docker run -it <container> /bin/bash`
   - C. `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`
   - D. `docker spawn -it <container> /bin/bash`

   <Solution>

   (C) `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`. The `docker exec` command is
   used to execute a process in a container. Using the `-it` option tells the
   `exec` command to use an interactive terminal for its execution. The process
   you want to execute is the last parameter, and since we want to gain access
   to the container's Bash shell, we are executing `/bin/bash`.

   </Solution>

6. When a container is stopped, the Docker daemon will delete all traces of the
   container.

   - A. True
   - B. False

   <Solution>

   (B) False. When you stop a running container, the daemon will only stop the
   running image. The container layer will remain on the host's filesystem. If
   you want to delete the container, you must remove the container from the
   daemon using the `docker rm` command.

   </Solution>

7. What command will show you a list of all containers, including any stopped
   containers?

   - A. `docker ps -all`
   - B. `docker ps -a`
   - C. `docker ps -list`
   - D. `docker list all`

   <Solution>

   (B) `docker ps -a`. To view a list of all containers that are running and
   have been stopped, use the `docker ps -a` command. If you use `-all` or
   `-list`, the daemon will interpret the option as `-l`, which will only list
   the latest containers. Listing the latest containers will exclude containers
   that have been stopped for a longer period of time.

   </Solution>

8. Add a user account to the `docker` group.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   sudo groupadd docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   </Solution>

9. Run the `hello-world` container.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   docker run hello-world
   ```

   </Solution>

10. Get help from the `docker` CLI.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker help
    ```

    </Solution>

11. Run an NGINX container in an interactive TTY session.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -it bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

12. Same but in detached mode.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -dit bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

13. Same but name the container `nginx-test`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -dit --name nginx-test bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

14. List all running containers.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker ps
    ```

    </Solution>

15. List all running and stopped containers.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker ps -a
    ```

    </Solution>

16. Stop a running container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker stop nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

17. Start the stopped container with all of the options that it was originally
    started with, including any networks or volumes that were assigned.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker start nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

18. Attach to the running NGINX container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker attach nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

19. Detach from that container without stopping the container.

    <Solution>
      You can detach from a container and leave it running using the{" "}
      <Kbd>Ctrl + P</Kbd> and <Kbd>Ctrl + Q</Kbd> key sequence.
    </Solution>

20. Retreive logs from a container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

21. Follow the log output of a container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs -f nginx-test
    docker logs --follow nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

22. Show the 10 last lines of the log output.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs --tail 10 nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

23. Show the log output before a timestamp, and before a relative time.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs --until 2020-02-23T18:35:13 nginx-test
    docker logs --until 60m nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

24. Show the log output after a timestamp, and after a relative time.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs --since 2020-02-23T18:35:13 nginx-test
    docker logs --since 60m nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

25. Remove a container with its attached volumes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker rm -v nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>
