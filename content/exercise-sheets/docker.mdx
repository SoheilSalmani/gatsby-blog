1. A single Docker image can be used on any Docker host, regardless of the
   architecture used.

   - A. True
   - B. False

   <Solution>
     (B) False. A container that is based on one architecture cannot be run on a
     different architecture. For example, an image created using the x86
     architecture will not run on an ARM-based architecture.
   </Solution>

2. What does Docker use to merge multiple image layers into a single filesystem?

   - A. Merged filesystem
   - B. NTFS filesystem
   - C. EXT4 filesystem
   - D. Union filesystem

   <Solution>
     (D) Union filesystem. Docker uses the Union filesystem to manage multiple
     image layers. The layers are read from top to bottom to provide the
     appearance of a single filesystem.
   </Solution>

3. What is the most commonly used Docker storage driver when using a Kernel that
   is above version 4.0?

   - A. AUFS
   - B. ZFS
   - C. VFS
   - D. Overlay2

   <Solution>
     (D) Overlay2. A system running a kernel that's version 4.0 or above will
     use the Overlay2 storage driver.
   </Solution>

4. When you edit a container's filesystem interactively, what layer are the
   changes written to?

   - A. Operating system layer
   - B. Bottom-most layer
   - C. Container layer
   - D. Ephemeral layer

   <Solution>
     (C) Container layer. Any changes that are made to a running container's
     filesystem are stored in the topmost layer, called the container layer.
   </Solution>

5. Assuming the image contains the required binaries, what Docker command allows
   you to gain access to a container's bash prompt?

   - A. `docker shell -it <container> /bin/bash`
   - B. `docker run -it <container> /bin/bash`
   - C. `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`
   - D. `docker spawn -it <container> /bin/bash`

   <Solution>

   (C) `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`. The `docker exec` command is
   used to execute a process in a container. Using the `-it` option tells the
   `exec` command to use an interactive terminal for its execution. The process
   you want to execute is the last parameter, and since we want to gain access
   to the container's Bash shell, we are executing `/bin/bash`.

   </Solution>

6. When a container is stopped, the Docker daemon will delete all traces of the
   container.

   - A. True
   - B. False

   <Solution>

   (B) False. When you stop a running container, the daemon will only stop the
   running image. The container layer will remain on the host's filesystem. If
   you want to delete the container, you must remove the container from the
   daemon using the `docker rm` command.

   </Solution>

7. What command will show you a list of all containers, including any stopped
   containers?

   - A. `docker ps -all`
   - B. `docker ps -a`
   - C. `docker ps -list`
   - D. `docker list all`

   <Solution>

   (B) `docker ps -a`. To view a list of all containers that are running and
   have been stopped, use the `docker ps -a` command. If you use `-all` or
   `-list`, the daemon will interpret the option as `-l`, which will only list
   the latest containers. Listing the latest containers will exclude containers
   that have been stopped for a longer period of time.

   </Solution>

8. Add a user account to the `docker` group.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   sudo groupadd docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   </Solution>

9. Run the `hello-world` container.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   docker run hello-world
   ```

   </Solution>

10. Get help from the `docker` CLI.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker help
    ```

    </Solution>

11. Run an NGINX container in an interactive TTY session.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -it bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

12. Same but in detached mode.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -dit bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

13. Same but name the container `nginx-test`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -dit --name nginx-test bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

14. List all running containers.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker ps
    ```

    </Solution>

15. List all running and stopped containers.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker ps -a
    ```

    </Solution>

16. Stop a running container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker stop nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

17. Start the stopped container with all of the options that it was originally
    started with, including any networks or volumes that were assigned.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker start nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

18. Attach to the running NGINX container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker attach nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

19. Detach from that container without stopping the container.

    <Solution>
      You can detach from a container and leave it running using the{" "}
      <Kbd>Ctrl + P</Kbd> and <Kbd>Ctrl + Q</Kbd> key sequence.
    </Solution>

20. Retreive logs from a container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

21. Follow the log output of a container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs -f nginx-test
    docker logs --follow nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

22. Show the 10 last lines of the log output.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs --tail 10 nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

23. Show the log output before a timestamp, and before a relative time.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs --until 2020-02-23T18:35:13 nginx-test
    docker logs --until 60m nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

24. Show the log output after a timestamp, and after a relative time.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker logs --since 2020-02-23T18:35:13 nginx-test
    docker logs --since 60m nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

25. Remove a container with its attached volumes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker rm -v nginx-test
    ```

    </Solution>

26. Create a new Docker volume named `html-data`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker volume create html-data
    ```

    </Solution>

27. Run a container with the volumed mounted. Also, set a random environment
    variable at launch.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run --name nginx -v html-data:/opt/web/data -e RANDOM_ENV=foo -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

28. Inspect There are two Boltdb databases containing metadata for Docker
    volumes and for Docker networks.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/metadata.db
    ```

    ```shell
    cat /var/lib/docker/network/files/local-kv.db
    ```

    </Solution>

29. Mount a volume in multiple containers.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run --name webserver01 -v webdata:/opt/web/data -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    docker run --name webserver02 -v webdata:/opt/web/data -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    docker run --name webserver03 -v webdata:/opt/web/data -d bitnami/nginx:latest

    ```

    </Solution>

30. List all Docker volumes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker volume ls
    ```

    </Solution>

31. Delete a container with its associated volume in one command.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker rm -v webserver04
    ```

    </Solution>

32. Delete multiple Docker volumes in one command:

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker volume rm webserver01 webserver02 webserver03
    ```

    </Solution>

33. Delete unused volumes:

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker volume prune
    ```

    </Solution>

34. Run a container with a created bind mount.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -d -v /home/soheil/Projects/python-project:/bin/python-project ubuntu:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

35. Run a container with a created bind mount.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -d -v /home/soheil/Desktop/Projects/python-project:/bin/python-project ubuntu:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

36. Run a container with a created tmpfs mount. The size of the tmpfs volume
    should be 1MB.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run --mount type=tmpfs,target=/opt/html,tmpfs-mode=1770,tmpfs-size=1000000 --name nginx-test -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

37. Verify the tmpfs mount in the container (two methods).

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker inspect <container>
    docker exec nginx-test df -h
    ```

    </Solution>

38. Which of the following volumes provides persistent storage for containers?

    - A. tmpfs
    - B. Bind mounts
    - C. Volumes
    - D. SAN

    <Solution>
      (B) Bind mounts and (C) Volumes. Only a Docker volume and bind mount
      provide persistency to a container. tmpfs volumes are stored in RAM and
      are not written to disk.
    </Solution>

39. Docker volumes must be created before they can be mounted.

    - A. True
    - B. False

    <Solution>
      (A) True. A volume must be created before it can be used in a container.
      If a volume is not created before running a container, Docker will create
      the volume before mounting it to the container.
    </Solution>

40. You create a tmpfs volume on a host that has 64 GB of RAM. During its
    creation, you failed to set a size. What size volume will Docker create?

    - A. 1 GB
    - B. 64 GB
    - C. 20 GB
    - D. 32 GB

    <Solution>
      (D) 32 GB. If a tmpfs size is not specified, Docker will create a volume
      that is equal to half of the host's RAM.
    </Solution>

41. Docker volumes are automatically deleted when you remove a container.

    - A. True
    - B. False

    <Solution>

    (B) False. Stopping or removing an image will not remove a persistent volume
    by default. To delete a volume, you can add the `-v` option to the
    `docker rm` command, or you can use the `docker volume rm` command to remove
    the volume manually.

    </Solution>

42. Which volume type is managed by the Docker daemon?

    - A. Bind volumes
    - B. Named volumes
    - C. All volumes
    - D. None

    <Solution>
      (B) Named volumes. Only anonymous and named volumes are managed by the
      Docker daemon.
    </Solution>

43. How do you delete an unused bind volume?

    - A. There is no need to; Docker will delete it automatically
    - B. `docker volume prune`
    - C. `docker volume bind prune`
    - D. You must manually delete the bind folder

    <Solution>
      (D) You must manually delete the Bind folder. Since Bind mounts are not
      managed by Docker, the daemon cannot delete unused volumes. To remove a
      Bind mount, you need to manually delete the directory that the Bind mount
      used.
    </Solution>

44. View all the existing networks on a Docker host.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network ls
    ```

    </Solution>

45. Look at the details of a Docker network on the host.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network inspect <network-name>
    ```

    </Solution>

46. Create a new user-defined network called `frontend`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network create frontend
    ```

    </Solution>

47. Create a second user-defined netowrk called `backend` which uses the
    `192.168.10.0/24` subnet using a gateway of `192.168.10.1`.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network create backend --subnet=192.168.10.0/24 --gateway=192.168.10.1
    ```

    </Solution>

48. Connect a container to the `frontend` network when starting the container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run --network frontend --name nginx1 -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

49. Change the network from `frontend` to `backend` on the running container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network connect backend nginx1
    docker network disconnect frontend nginx1
    ```

    </Solution>

50. Delete a user-defined network.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network rm frontend
    ```

    </Solution>

51. Delete all networks not attached to a container.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker network prune
    ```

    </Solution>

52. Start a container without an attached network.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run --network none --name nginx1 -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

53. Start a container which uses a host network.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run --network host --name nginx -d bitnami/nginx/latest
    ```

    </Solution>

54. Expose ports of a container which uses a bridge network. Expose one port as
    a UDP port.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -p 3000:3000/udp --name nginx -d bitnami/nginx:latest
    ```

    </Solution>

55. Since Docker creates a default bridge network, there is no reason to create
    a custom bridge.

    - A. True
    - B. False

    <Solution>
      (B) False. The default bridge assigned by Docker has limitations. It is
      considered a best practice to create a custom bridge network if you plan
      to run multiple containers on your host.
    </Solution>

56. Which of the following is an example of a socket?

    - A. `http:192.168.100.10`
    - B. `192.168.100.10`
    - C. `192.168.100.10:80`
    - D. `https://192.168.100.10`

    <Solution>

    (C) `192.168.100.10:80`. A socket is a combination of an IP address and a
    port. `192.168.100.10:80` is a socket for a server running a service on port
    80 with an IP address of `192.168.100.10`.

    </Solution>

57. How would you start a container running a web server on port `8080` named
    `nginx-web` on a host that already has its host port (`8080`) bound to
    another container?

    - A. `docker run -d nginx-web bitnami/nginx`
    - B. `docker run -p 8080:8080 -d nginx-web bitnami/nginx –force`
    - C. `docker run -p 8081:8080 -d nginx-web bitnami/nginx`
    - D. Since port `8080` is bound on the host, you cannot run a container on
      port `8080`

    <Solution>

    (C) `docker run -p 8081:8080 -d nginx-web bitnami/nginx`. Since the host has
    already bound port `8080` to another service, we cannot start the new
    container using `8080:8080`. Since each Docker container has its own IP
    address, we can still use port `8080` for the container, but the incoming
    host port assignment must use an unused port. The only correct answer is C,
    since it binds the host's port, `8081`, to the container port running on
    port `8080`.

    </Solution>

58. You suspect an image may contain malware. You need to run the image safely
    to look at its contents. What Docker command will mitigate any network
    impact?

    - A. `docker run -isolate -it badimage bash`
    - B. `docker run -p 0:0 -it badimage bash`
    - C. `docker run -it badimage bash`
    - D. `docker run --network=none -it badimage bash`

    <Solution>

    (D) `docker run --network=none -it badimage bash`. If you start a container
    without supplying any network options, the container will attempt to run on
    the default Docker bridge network. To start a container without a network
    you can set the network to none by running the image with the
    `–network=none` option.

    </Solution>

59. Once a container is connected to a custom bridge network, you cannot change
    the connected network.

    - A. True
    - B. False

    <Solution>
      (B) False. Being able to change the connected network on the fly is a
      feature of custom bridge networks.
    </Solution>

60. What is the highest IP port number you can expose on a container?

    - A. There is no limit
    - B. 65535
    - C. 65530
    - D. 65532
    - E. 65435

    <Solution>

    (B) `65535`. The valid port range for IP ports is `1-65535`.

    </Solution>
