1. Define what sample points are. Give an other term used to mention these
   elements.

   <Solution>

   Let us consider an experiment of which all possible results are included in a
   finite number of outcomes $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_N$. We call
   $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_N$ _elementary events_, or _sample points_.

   </Solution>

2. Define what a sample space is. Give an other term used to mention that set.

   <Solution>

   The (finite) space of elementary events or the sample space is the finite set

   $$
   \Omega = \{\omega_1,\dots,\omega_N\} \, .
   $$

   </Solution>

3. Give $\Omega$ for a single toss of a coin.

   <Solution>

   For a single toss of a coin the sample space $\Omega$ consists of two points:

   $$
   \Omega = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\} \, ,
   $$

   where $\text{H} = \text{"head"}$ and $\text{T} = \text{"tail"}$.

   </Solution>

4. Give $\Omega$ for $n$ tosses of a coin. Give the value of $N(\Omega)$.

   <Solution>

   For $n$ tosses of a coin the sample space is

   $$
   \Omega = \{\omega : \omega=(a_1,\dots,a_n), a_i=\text{H or T}\}
   $$

   and the total number $N(\Omega)$ of outcomes is $2^n$.

   </Solution>

5. Give $\Omega$ for the following experiment. First toss a coin. If it falls
   “head” then toss a die; if it falls “tail,” toss the coin again.

   <Solution>

   The sample space for this experiment is

   $$
   \Omega = \{\text{H1},\text{H2},\text{H3},\text{H4},\text{H5},\text{H6},\text{TH},\text{TT}\} \, .
   $$

   </Solution>

6. We consider the selection of $n$ balls from an urn containing $M$
   distinguishable balls. We consider the case where the order in which the
   balls are drawn matters. In the context of sampling with replacement, give
   $\Omega$ and $N(\Omega)$.

   <Solution>

   The balls are numbered $1,\dots,M$, so that each sample of $n$ balls can be
   presented in the form $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$, where $a_i$ is the label of the ball
   drawn at the $i$th step.

   Thus the sample space has the form

   $$
   \Omega = \{\omega : \omega=(a_1,\dots,a_n), a_i=1,\dots,M\}
   $$

   and the number of (different) outcomes, which in combinatorics are called
   _arrangements_ of $n$ out of $M$ elements _with repetitions_, is

   $$
   N(\Omega) = M^n \, .
   $$

   </Solution>

7. Same but this time, we consider the case where the order in which the balls
   are drawn doesn't matter. Justify your answer for $N(\Omega)$.

   <Solution>

   If we consider _unordered_ samples _with replacement_ (called in
   combinatorics _combinations_ of $n$ out of $M$ elements _with repetitions_),
   then

   $$
   \Omega = \{\omega : \omega=[a_1,\dots,a_n], a_i=1,\dots,M\} \, .
   $$

   Clearly the number $N(\Omega)$ of (different) unordered samples is smaller
   than the number of ordered samples. Let us show that in the present case

   $$
   N(\Omega) = C^n_{M+n-1} \, ,
   $$

   where $C_k^l = k!/[l!(k-l)!]$ is the number of combinations of $k$ elements,
   taken $l$ at a time.

   We prove this by induction. Let $N(M,n)$ be the number of outcomes of
   interest. It is clear that when $k \le M$ we have

   $$
   N(k,1) = k = C^1_k \, .
   $$

   Now suppose that $N(k,n) = C^n_{k+n-1}$ for $k \le M$; we will show that this
   formula continues to hold when $n$ is replaced by $n+1$. For the unordered
   samples $[a_1,\dots,a_{n+1}]$ that we are considering, we may suppose that
   the elements are arranged in nondecreasing order:
   $a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_{n+1}$. It is clear that the number of
   unordered samples of size $n+1$ with $a_1 = 1$ is $N(M,n)$, the number with
   $a_1 = 2$ is $N(M-1,n)$, etc. Consequently

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   N(M,n+1) &= N(M,n) + N(M-1,n) + \cdots + N(1,n) \\
            &= C^n_{M+n-1} + C^n_{M-1+n-1} + \cdots + C^n_n \\
            &= (C^{n+1}_{M+n}-C^{n+1}_{M+n-1}) + (C^{n+1}_{M-1+n}-C^{n+1}_{M-1+n-1}) + \cdots + (C^{n+1}_{n+2}-C^{n+1}_{n+1}) + C^n_n = C^{n+1}_{M+n} \, ;
   \end{aligned}
   $$

   here we have used the easily verified property

   $$
   C^{l-1}_k + C^l_k = C^l_{k+1}
   $$

   of the _binomial coefficients_ $C^l_k$.

   </Solution>

8. Same but this time, in the context of sampling without replacement and where
   the order matters.

   <Solution>

   Suppose that n ≤ M and that the selected balls are not returned.

   For _ordered_ samples _without replacement_ (called in combinatorics
   _arrangements_ of _n_ out of _M_ elements _without repetitions_) the sample
   space

   $$
   \Omega = \{\omega : \omega = (a_1,\dots,a_n), a_k \ne a_l, k \ne l, a_i=1,\dots,M\} \, ,
   $$

   consists of $M(M-1)\dots(M-n+1)$ elements. This number is denoted by $(M)_n$
   or $A^n_M$ and is called the number of _arragements of $n$ out of $M$
   elements_.

   </Solution>

9. Same but this time, in the context of sampling without replacement and where
   the order doesn't matter. Justify your answer for $N(\Omega)$.

   <Solution>

   For _unordered_ samples _without replacement_ (called in combinatorics
   _combinations_ of $n$ out of $M$ elements _without repetitions_) the sample
   space

   $$
   \Omega = \{ \omega : \omega = [a_1,\dots,a_n], a_k \ne a_l, k \ne l, a_i=1,\dots,M \}
   $$

   consists of

   $$
   N(\Omega) = C^n_M
   $$

   elements. In fact, from each unordered sample $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$ consisting of
   distinct elements we can obtain $n!$ ordered samples. Consequently

   $$
   N(\Omega) \cdot n! = (M)_n
   $$

   and therefore

   $$
   N(\Omega) = \frac{(M)_n}{n!} = C^n_M \, .
   $$

   </Solution>
