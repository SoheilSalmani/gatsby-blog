1. Define what $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are. What are the subsets of $\Omega$
   called?

   <Solution>

   The **sample space** $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes of an
   experiment. Points $\omega$ in n are called **sample outcomes**,
   **realizations**, or **elements**. Subsets of $\Omega$ are called **events**.

   </Solution>

2. If we toss a coin twice, what is $\Omega$? Give the event that the first toss
   is heads.

   <Solution>

   If we toss a coin twice then $\Omega = \{ HH,HT,TH,TT \}$. The event that the
   first toss is heads is $A = \{ HH,HT \}$.

   </Solution>

3. Let $\omega$ be the outcome of a measurement of some phyisical quantity, give
   $\Omega$. Give the event that the measurement is larger than 10 but less than
   or equal to 23.

   <Solution>

   We can set $\Omega = \mathbb{R} = (-\infty,\infty)$. The event that the
   measurement is larger than 10 but less than or equal to 23 is $A = (10, 23]$.

   **Note:** There is usually no harm in taking the sample space to be larger
   than needed.

   </Solution>

4. If we to a coin forever, what is $\Omega$? Give the event that the first head
   appears on the third toss.

   <Solution>

   If we toss a coin forever , then the sample space is the infinite set

   $$
   \Omega = \{ \omega = (\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3,\dots,) : \omega_i \in \{H,T\} \} \, .
   $$

   Let $E$ be the event that the first head appears on the third toss. Then

   $$
   E = \{ (\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3,\dots,) : \omega_1 = T, \omega_2 = T, \omega_3 = H, \omega_i \in \{H,T\} \ \text{for $i > 3$} \} \, .
   $$

   </Solution>

5. Define the complement of $A$.

   <Solution>

   Given an event $A$, let $A^c = \{ \omega \in \Omega : \omega \notin A \}$
   denote the complement of $A$. Informally, $A^c$ can be read as "not $A$."

   </Solution>

6. What is the complement of $\Omega$.

   <Solution>

   The complement of $\Omega$ is the empty set $\emptyset$.

   </Solution>

7. Define the union of events $A$ and $B$.

   <Solution>

   The union of events $A$ and $B$ is defined

   $$
   A \bigcup B = \{ \omega \in \Omega : \omega \in A \ \text{or} \ \omega \in B \ \text{or} \ \omega \in \text{both} \}
   $$

   which can be though as "$A$ or $B$".

   </Solution>

8. Same but in the case of a sequence of sets $A_1,A_2,\dots$.

   <Solution>

   If $A_1,A_2,\dots$ is a sequence of sets then

   $$
   \bigcup^\infty_{i=1} A_i = \{ \omega \in \Omega : \omega \in A_i \ \text{for at least one $i$} \} \, .
   $$

   </Solution>

9. Define the intersection of $A$ and $B$.

   <Solution>

   The intersection of $A$ and $B$ is

   $$
   A \bigcap B = \{ \omega \in \Omega : \omega \in A \ \text{and} \ \omega \in B \}
   $$

   read "$A$ and $B$". Sometimes we write $A \bigcap B$ as $AB$ or $(A,B)$.

   </Solution>

10. Same but in the case of a sequence of sets $A_1,A_2,\dots$.

    <Solution>

    If $A_1,A_2,\dots$ is a sequence of sets then

    $$
    \bigcap^\infty_{i=1} A_i = \{ \omega \in \Omega : \omega \in A_i \ \text{for all $i$} \} \, .
    $$

    </Solution>

11. Define the set difference.

    <Solution>

    The set difference is defined by
    $A - B = \{ \omega : \omega \in A, \omega \notin B \}$.

    </Solution>

12. What does $A \subset B$ (or, equivalently, $B \supset A) mean?

    <Solution>

    If every element of $A$ is also contained in $B$ we write $A \subset B$ or,
    equivalently, $B \supset A$.

    </Solution>

13. What does $|A|$ mean?

    <Solution>

    If $A$ is a finite set, let $|A|$ denote the number of elements in $A$.

    </Solution>

14. Write a summary of terminology.

    <Solution>

    - $\Omega$: sample space
    - $\omega$: outcome (point or element)
    - $A$: event (subset of $\Omega$)
    - $A^c$: complement of $A$ (not $A$)
    - $A \bigcup B$: union ($A$ of $B$)
    - $A \bigcap B$ or $AB$: intersection ($A$ and $B$)
    - $A - B$: set difference ($\omega$ in $A$ but not in $B$)
    - $A \subset B$: set inclusion
    - $\emptyset$: null event (always false)
    - $\Omega$: true event (always true)

    </Solution>

15. What are disjoint (or mutually exlusive) events?

    <Solution>

    We say that $A_1,A_2,\dots$ are **disjoint** or are **mutually exclusive**
    if $A_i \bigcap A_j = \emptyset$ whenever $i \ne j$. For example,
    $A_1 = [0,1)$, $A_2 = [1,2)$, $A_3 = [2,3)$,... are disjoint.

    </Solution>

16. What is a partition of $\Omega$?

    <Solution>

    A **partition** of $\Omega$ is a sequence of disjoint sets $A_1,A_2,\dots$
    such that $\bigcup^\infty_{i=1} A_i = \Omega$.

    </Solution>

17. Define the indicator function of $A$.

    <Solution>

    Given an event $A$, define the **indicator function of $A$** by

    $$
    I_A(\omega) = I(\omega \in A) = \begin{cases}
        1 \ \text{if $\omega \in A$} \\
        0 \ \text{if $\omega \notin A$} \, .
    \end{cases}
    $$

    </Solution>

18. What does it mean that a sequence of sets is monotone increasing? Define
    $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n$.

    <Solution>

    A sequence of sets $A_1,A_2,\dots$ is **monotone increasing** if
    $A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \cdots$ and we define
    $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$.

    </Solution>

19. What does it mean that a sequence of sets is monotone decreasing? Define
    $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n$.

    <Solution>

    A sequence of sets $A_1,A_2,\dots$ is **monotone decreasing** if
    $A_1 \supset A_2 \supset \cdots$ and then we define
    $\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcap^\infty_{i=1} A_i$.

    </Solution>

20. Let $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ and let $A_i = [0,1/i)$ for $i = 1,2,\dots$. Give
    $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ and $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i$.

    <Solution>

    $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i = [0,1)$ and $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i = \{0\}$.

    </Solution>

21. Let $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ and let $A_i = (0,1/i)$ for $i = 1,2,\dots$. Give
    $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ and $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i$.

    <Solution>

    $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i = (0,1)$ and
    $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i = \emptyset$.

    </Solution>
