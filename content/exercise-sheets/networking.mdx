1. Give to generic terms to specify devices connected to the Internet.

   <Solution>

   Hosts and end systems.

   End systems are also referred to as _hosts_ because they host (that is, run)
   application programs.

   </Solution>

2. Give the two main elements used in a network to connect end systems.

   <Solution>Communication links and packet switches.</Solution>

3. What is the transmission rate?

   <Solution>
     It's the amount of data transmitted per second, measured in bits/second, in
     a communication link.
   </Solution>

4. What is packets?

   <Solution>
     When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end
     system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The
     resulting packages of information, known as packets in the jargon of
     computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end
     system, where they are reassembled into the original data.{" "}
   </Solution>

5. What is the role of a packet switch?

   <Solution>
     A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming
     communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing
     communication links.
   </Solution>

6. What are the two most prominent types of packet switches? In which type of
   network each of them is typically used?

   <Solution>
     A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming
     communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing
     communication links. The two most prominent types of packet switches in
     today’s Internet are routers and link-layer switches. Both types of
     switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer
     switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically
     used in the network core.
   </Solution>

7. What is a route (or path)?

   <Solution>
     It's the sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a
     packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system.
   </Solution>

8. What is an ISP?

   <Solution>
     End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
     Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links.
     ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems. ISPs
     also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting servers
     directly to the Internet.
   </Solution>

9. How ISPs internconnect each other in the Internet?

   <Solution>
     The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, ISPs that
     provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These lowertier
     ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier
     ISPs and these upper-tier ISPs are connected directly to each other. An
     upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with
     high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or
     lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the IP protocol, and conforms to
     certain naming and address conventions.
   </Solution>

10. What is protocol?

    <Solution>

    All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote
    entities is governed by a protocol.

    A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
    two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the
    transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

    The Internet, and computer networks in general, make extensive use of
    protocols. Different protocols are used to accomplish different
    communication tasks.

    </Solution>

11. Give two of the most important protocols in the Internet?

    <Solution>
      Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).
    </Solution>

12. What is the name given to collectively refer the Internet’s principal
    protocols?

    <Solution>
      The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP.
    </Solution>

13. What is the role of the IP protocol?

    <Solution>
      The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and
      received among routers and end systems.
    </Solution>

14. What action has been taken to make all Internet systems and products
    interoperable?

    <Solution>The definition of Internet standards.</Solution>

15. Who develop the Internet standards? How?

    <Solution>
      Internet standards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF). The IETF standards documents are called requests for comments
      (RFCs). RFCs started out as general requests for comments to resolve
      network and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the
      Internet.
    </Solution>

16. Cite 4 protocols defined by the IETF.

    <Solution>TCP, IP, HTTP and SMTP.</Solution>

17. How are called applications which involve multiple end systems that exchange
    data with each other?

    <Solution>
      These applications are said to be distributed applications.
    </Solution>

18. What is a socket interface?

    <Solution>
      End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that
      specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet
      infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running
      on another end system.
    </Solution>

19. What are the two categories of hosts?

    <Solution>

    Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: **clients** and
    **servers**. Informally, clients tend to be desktops, laptops, smartphones,
    and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and
    distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail, and so on. Today, most of
    the servers from which we receive search results, e-mail, Web pages, videos
    and mobile app content reside in large **data centers**.

    </Solution>

20. What is an access network? Draw a schema to explain.

    <Solution>

    The access network is the network that physically connects an end system to
    the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end
    system to any other distant end system.

    </Solution>

21. Describe how DSL Internet access works (and draw a schema).

    <Solution>

    Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are
    **digital subscriber line (DSL)** and cable. A residence typically obtains
    DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that
    provides its wired local phone access. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s
    telco is also its ISP. Each customer’s DSL modem uses the existing telephone
    line exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM)
    located in the telco’s local central office (CO). The home’s DSL modem takes
    digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over
    telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals from many such houses are
    translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.

    The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone
    signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:

    - A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
    - A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
    - An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

    This approach makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three
    separate links, so that a telephone call and an Internet connection can
    share the DSL link at the same time. On the customer side, a splitter
    separates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home and forwards
    the data signal to the DSL modem. On the telco side, in the CO, the DSLAM
    separates the data and phone signals and sends the data into the Internet.
    Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a single DSLAM.

    <Figure src="/media/dsl-internet-access.png">DSL Internet access.</Figure>

    The DSL standards define multiple transmission rates, including downstream
    transmission rates of 24 Mbps and 52 Mbps, and upstream rates of 3.5 Mbps
    and 16 Mbps; the newest standard provides for aggregate upstream plus
    downstream rates of 1 Gbps. Because the downstream and upstream rates are
    different, the access is said to be asymmetric. The actual downstream and
    upstream transmission rates achieved may be less than the rates noted above,
    as the DSL provider may purposefully limit a residential rate when tiered
    service (different rates, available at different prices) are offered. The
    maximum rate is also limited by the distance between the home and the CO,
    the gauge of the twisted-pair line and the degree of electrical
    interference. Engineers have expressly designed DSL for short distances
    between the home and the CO; generally, if the residence is not located
    within 5 to 10 miles.

    </Solution>

22. Describe how cable Internet access works (and draw a schema).

    <Solution>

    While DSL makes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure,
    **cable Internet access** makes use of the cable television company’s
    existing cable television infrastructure. A residence obtains cable Internet
    access from the same company that provides its cable television. Fiber
    optics connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from
    which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and
    apartments. Each neighborhood junction typically supports 500 to 5,000
    homes. Because both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in this system, it
    is often referred to as hybrid fiber coax (HFC).

    <Figure src="/media/hfc-access-network.png">
      A hybrid fiber-coaxial access network.
    </Figure>

    At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a
    similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM— turning the analog signal sent
    from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.

    Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an
    upstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the
    downstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the
    upstream channel. The DOCSIS 2.0 and 3.0 standards define downstream
    bitrates of 40 Mbps and 1.2 Gbps, and upstream rates of 30 Mbps and 100
    Mbps, respectively. As in the case of DSL networks, the maximum achievable
    rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media
    impairments.

    One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared
    broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels
    downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home
    travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several
    users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel,
    the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be
    significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other
    hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing,
    then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable
    downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at exactly
    the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed
    multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid
    collisions.

    </Solution>

23. Describe how FTTH works (and draw a schema).

    <Solution>

    Although DSL and cable networks currently represent the majority of
    residential broadband access in the United States, an up-and-coming
    technology that provides even higher speeds is **fiber to the home (FTTH)**.
    As the name suggests, the FTTH concept is simple—provide an optical fiber
    path from the CO directly to the home. FTTH can potentially provide Internet
    access rates in the gigabits per second range.

    There are several competing technologies for optical distribution from the
    CO to the homes. The simplest optical distribution network is called direct
    fiber, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each
    fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not
    until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into
    individual customer-specific fibers. There are two competing
    optical-distribution network architectures that perform this splitting:
    active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical networks (PONs). AON is
    essentially switched Ethernet.

    Here, we briefly discuss PON, which is used in Verizon’s FiOS service. Each
    home has an optical network terminator (ONT), which is connected by
    dedicated optical fiber to a neighborhood splitter. The splitter combines a
    number of homes (typically less than 100) onto a single, shared optical
    fiber, which connects to an optical line terminator (OLT) in the telco’s CO.
    The OLT, providing conversion between optical and electrical signals,
    connects to the Internet via a telco router. At home, users connect a home
    router (typically a wireless router) to the ONT and access the Internet via
    this home router. In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the
    splitter are replicated at the splitter (similar to a cable head end).

24. Describe how 5G fixed wireless works?

    <Solution>

    In addition to DSL, Cable, and FTTH, **5G fixed wireless** is beginning to
    be deployed. 5G fixed wireless not only promises high-speed residential
    access, but will do so without installing costly and failure-prone cabling
    from the telco’s CO to the home. With 5G fixed wireless, using beam-forming
    technology, data is sent wirelessly from a provider’s base station to the a
    modem in the home. A WiFi wireless router is connected to the modem
    (possibly bundled together), similar to how a WiFi wireless router is
    connected to a cable or DSL modem.

    </Solution>

25. Describe how access in enterprises (and by extension homes) works with
    Ethernet and WiFi. Draw schemas to explain.

    <Solution>

    On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a
    local area!network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge
    router. Although there are many types of LAN technologies, Ethernet is by
    far the most prevalent access technology in corporate, university, and home
    networks.

    <Figure src="/media/ethernet-internet-access.png">
      Ethernet Internet access.
    </Figure>

    Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet
    switch. The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches,
    is then in turn connected into the larger Internet.

    Increasingly, however, people are accessing the Internet wirelessly from
    laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other “things”. In a wireless LAN
    setting, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point
    that is connected into the enterprise’s network (most likely using wired
    Ethernet), which in turn is connected to the wired Internet. A wireless LAN
    user must typically be within a few tens of meters of the access point.
    Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology, more colloquially known
    as WiFi.

    Even though Ethernet and WiFi access networks were initially deployed in
    enterprise (corporate, university) settings, they are also common components
    of home networks. Many homes combine broadband residential access (that is,
    cable modems or DSL) with these inexpensive wireless LAN technologies to
    create powerful home networks.

    <Figure src="/media/typical-home-network.png">
      A typical home network.
    </Figure>

    This home network consists of a roaming laptop, multiple Internet-connected
    home appliances, as well as a wired PC; a base station (the wireless access
    point), which communicates with the wireless PC and other wireless devices
    in the home; and a home router that connects the wireless access point, and
    any other wired home devices, to the Internet.

    </Solution>

26. Name technology standards which allow wide-area wireless access?

    <Solution>3G, 4G and 5G.</Solution>
