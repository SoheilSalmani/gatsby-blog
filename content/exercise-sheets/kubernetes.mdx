## Kubernetes in Action

1. What type of nodes compose a Kubernetes cluster?

   <Solution>

   At the hardware level, a Kubernetes cluster is composed of many nodes, which
   can be split into two types:

   - The _master_ node, which hosts the _Kubernetes Control Plane_ that controls
     and manages the whole Kubernetes system
   - Worker _nodes_ that run the actual applications you deploy

2. Explain what the Kubernetes Control Plane is.

   <Solution>

   The Control Plane is what controls the cluster and makes it function. It
   consists of multiple components that can run on a single master node or be
   split across multiple nodes and replicated to ensure high availability. These
   components are

   - The _Kubernetes API Server_, which you and the other Control Plane
     components communicate with
   - The _Scheduler_, which schedules your apps (assigns a worker node to each
     deployable component of your application)
   - The _Controller Manager_, which performs cluster-level functions, such as
     replicating components, keeping track of worker nodes, handling node
     failures, and so on
   - _etcd_, a reliable distributed data store that persistently stores the
     cluster configuration.

   The components of the Control Plane hold and control the state of the
   cluster, but they donâ€™t run your applications. This is done by the (worker)
   nodes.

   </Solution>

3. Explain what worker nodes are.

   <Solution>

   The worker nodes are the machines that run your containerized applications.
   The task of running, monitoring, and providing services to your applications
   is done by the following components:

   - Docker, rkt, or another _container runtime_, which runs your containers
   - The _Kubelet_, which talks to the API server and manages containers on its
     node
   - The _Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)_, which load-balances network
     traffic between application components.

   </Solution>

4. Draw a schema explaining how a given application run in a Kubernetes cluster.
