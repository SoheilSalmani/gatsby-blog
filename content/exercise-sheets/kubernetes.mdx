## Kubernetes in Action

1. What type of nodes compose a Kubernetes cluster?

   <Solution>

   At the hardware level, a Kubernetes cluster is composed of many nodes, which
   can be split into two types:

   - The _master_ node, which hosts the _Kubernetes Control Plane_ that controls
     and manages the whole Kubernetes system
   - Worker _nodes_ that run the actual applications you deploy

   </Figure>

   </Solution>

2. Explain what the Kubernetes Control Plane is.

   <Solution>

   The Control Plane is what controls the cluster and makes it function. It
   consists of multiple components that can run on a single master node or be
   split across multiple nodes and replicated to ensure high availability. These
   components are

   - The _Kubernetes API Server_, which you and the other Control Plane
     components communicate with
   - The _Scheduler_, which schedules your apps (assigns a worker node to each
     deployable component of your application)
   - The _Controller Manager_, which performs cluster-level functions, such as
     replicating components, keeping track of worker nodes, handling node
     failures, and so on
   - _etcd_, a reliable distributed data store that persistently stores the
     cluster configuration.

   The components of the Control Plane hold and control the state of the
   cluster, but they don’t run your applications. This is done by the (worker)
   nodes.

   </Solution>

3. Explain what worker nodes are.

   <Solution>

   The worker nodes are the machines that run your containerized applications.
   The task of running, monitoring, and providing services to your applications
   is done by the following components:

   - Docker, rkt, or another _container runtime_, which runs your containers
   - The _Kubelet_, which talks to the API server and manages containers on its
     node
   - The _Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)_, which load-balances network
     traffic between application components.

   </Solution>

4. Draw a schema explaining how a given application run in a Kubernetes cluster.

     on top of it.

   </Solution>

5. Install Minikube and run a local single-node Kubernetes cluster.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   minikube start
   ```

   </Solution>

6. Check to see the cluster is up and `kubectl` can talk to it.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```

   </Solution>

7. Log into the Minikube VM and explore it from the inside.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   minikube ssh
   ```

   </Solution>

8. Set up a Google Cloud project and download the necessary client binaries.

   <Solution>

   1. Enable the Kubernetes Engine API.
   2. Download and install Google Cloud SDK.
   3. Install the `kubectl` command-line tool with
      `gcloud components install kubectl`.

   </Solution>

9. Create a Kubernetes cluster with three nodes.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   gcloud container clusters create kubia --num-nodes 3 --machine-type f1-micro
   ```

   </Solution>

10. Check if the cluster is up by listing cluster nodes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    </Solution>

11. Log into one of the nodes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    gcloud compute ssh <node-name>
    ```

    </Solution>

12. Retrieve additional details on a node.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl describe node gke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx
    ```

    </Solution>

13. Retreive additional details on all nodes.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    </Solution>

14. Create an alias named `k` for `kubectl`.

    <Solution>

    ```bashrc fp=/home/<user>/.bashrc
    alias k=kubectl
    ```

    </Solution>

15. Using GKE, deploy a trivial Node.js app using a ReplicationController (use
    one pod).

    <Solution>

    ```yaml nu fp=kubia-rc.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ReplicationController
    metadata:
      name: kubia
      labels:
        run: kubia
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        run: kubia
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            run: kubia
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: kubia
              image: luksa/kubia:latest
              ports:
                - containerPort: 8080
                  protocol: TCP
    ```

    ```shell
    kubectl create -f kubia-rc.yaml
    ```

    </Solution>

16. List all pods.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    </Solution>

17. Get more information about the pod.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl describe pods <pod-name>
    ```

    </Solution>

18. Expose the ReplicationController you created earlier.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl expose rc kubia --type=LoadBalancer --name kubia-http
    ```

    </Solution>

19. List all services.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl get services
    ```

    </Solution>

20. Deploy the same cluster locally using Minikube.

    <Solution>

    Run all preceding commands. Then:

    ```shell
    minikube service kubia-http
    ```

    </Solution>

21. List all ReplicationControllers.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl get replicationcontrollers
    kubectl get rc
    ```

    </Solution>

22. Increase the desired replicas to three.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=3
    ```

    </Solution>

23. Hit the service multiple times.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    curl 104.155.74.57:8080
    curl 104.155.74.57:8080
    curl 104.155.74.57:8080
    curl 104.155.74.57:8080
    ```

    </Solution>

24. Display the pod IP and the pod's node when listing pods

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    ```

    </Solution>

25. Inspect other details of a pod.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    kubectl describe pod kubia-hczji
    ```

    </Solution>

26. Access the dashboard using GKE.

    <Solution>

    If you’re using Google Kubernetes Engine, you can find out the URL of the
    dashboard through the `kubectl cluster-info` command:

    ```shell
    kubectl cluster-info | grep dashboard
    ```

    If you open this URL in a browser, you’re presented with a username and
    password prompt. You’ll find the username and password by running the
    following command:

    ```shell
    gcloud container clusters describe kubia | grep -E "(username|password):"
    ```

    </Solution>

27. Access the dashboard using Minikube.

    <Solution>

    ```shell
    minikube dashboard
    ```

    </Solution>
