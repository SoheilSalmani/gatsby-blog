## Elementary Probability Theory

### Probabilistic Model of an Experiment with a Finite Number of Outcomes

Let us consider an experiment of which all possible results are included in a
finite number of outcomes $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_N$.

We call $\omega_1,\dots,\omega_N$ _elementary events_, or _sample points_, and
the finite set

$$
\Omega = \{\omega_1,\dots,\omega_N\} \, ,
$$

the (finite) _space of elementary events_ or the _sample space_.

The choice of the space of elementary events is the _first step_ in formulating
a _probabilistic model_ for an experiment.

#### Sampling with Replacement

This is an experiment in which at each step one ball is drawn at random and
returned again. The balls are numbered $1,\dots,M$, so that each sample of $n$
balls can be presented in the form $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$, where $a_i$ is the label
of the ball drawn at the $i$th step. It is customary to distinguish two cases:
_ordered_ samples and _unordered_ samples. To emphasize which kind of sample we
are considering, we use the notation $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ for _ordered_ and
$[a_1,\dots,a_n]$ for _unordered_ samples.

Thus for _ordered_ samples _with replacement_ the sample space has the form

$$
\Omega = \{\omega : \omega=(a_1,\dots,a_n), a_i=1,\dots,M\}
$$

and the number of (different) outcomes, which in combinatorics are called
_arrangements_ of $n$ out of $M$ elements _with repetitions_, is

$$
N(\Omega) = M^n \, .
$$

If, however, we consider _unordered_ samples _with replacement_ (called in
combinatorics _combinations_ of $n$ out of $M$ elements _with repetitions_),
then

$$
\Omega = \{\omega : \omega=[a_1,\dots,a_n], a_i=1,\dots,M\} \, .
$$

Clearly the number $N(\Omega)$ of (different) unordered samples is smaller than
the number of ordered samples. Let us show that in the present case

$$
N(\Omega) = C^n_{M+n-1} \, ,
$$

where $C_k^l = k!/[l!(k-l)!]$ is the number of combinations of $k$ elements,
taken $l$ at a time.

We prove this by induction. Let $N(M,n)$ be the number of outcomes of interest.
It is clear that when $k \le M$ we have

$$
N(k,1) = k = C^1_k \, .
$$

Now suppose that $N(k,n) = C^n_{k+n-1}$ for $k \le M$; we will show that this
formula continues to hold when $n$ is replaced by $n+1$. For the unordered
samples $[a_1,\dots,a_{n+1}]$ that we are considering, we may suppose that the
elements are arranged in nondecreasing order:
$a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_{n+1}$. It is clear that the number of unordered
samples of size $n+1$ with $a_1 = 1$ is $N(M,n)$, the number with $a_1 = 2$ is
$N(M-1,n)$, etc. Consequently

$$
\begin{aligned}
N(M,n+1) &= N(M,n) + N(M-1,n) + \cdots + N(1,n) \\
         &= C^n_{M+n-1} + C^n_{M-1+n-1} + \cdots + C^n_n \\
         &= (C^{n+1}_{M+n}-C^{n+1}_{M+n-1}) + (C^{n+1}_{M-1+n}-C^{n+1}_{M-1+n-1}) + \cdots + (C^{n+1}_{n+2}-C^{n+1}_{n+1}) + C^n_n = C^{n+1}_{M+n} \, ;
\end{aligned}
$$

here we have used the easily verified property

$$
C^{l-1}_k + C^l_k = C^l_{k+1}
$$

of the _binomial coefficients_ $C^l_k$.

#### Sampling Without Replacement

Suppose that $n \le M$ and that the selected balls are not returned. In this
case we again consider two possibilities, namely ordered and unordered samples.

For _ordered_ samples _without replacement_ (called in combinatorics
_arrangements_ of _n_ out of _M_ elements _without repetitions_) the sample
space

$$
\Omega = \{\omega : \omega = (a_1,\dots,a_n), a_k \ne a_l, k \ne l, a_i=1,\dots,M\} \, ,
$$

consists of $M(M-1)\dots(M-n+1)$ elements. This number is denoted by $(M)_n$ or
$A^n_M$ and is called the number of _arrangements of $n$ out of $M$ elements_.

For _unordered_ samples _without replacement_ (called in combinatorics
_combinations_ of $n$ out of $M$ elements _without repetitions_) the sample
space

$$
\Omega = \{ \omega : \omega = [a_1,\dots,a_n], a_k \ne a_l, k \ne l, a_i=1,\dots,M \}
$$

consists of

$$
N(\Omega) = C^n_M
$$

elements. In fact, from each unordered sample $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$ consisting of
distinct elements we can obtain $n!$ ordered samples. Consequently

$$
N(\Omega) \cdot n! = (M)_n
$$

and therefore

$$
N(\Omega) = \frac{(M)_n}{n!} = C^n_M \, .
$$
