## Getting started

### Meet Apache Airflow

#### Introducing data pipelines

Data pipelines generally consist of several tasks or actions that need to be
executed to achieve the desired result. For example, say we want to build a
small weather dashboard that tells us what the weather will be like in the
coming week. To implement this live weather dashboard, we need to perform
something like the following steps:

1. Fetch weather forecast data from a weather API.
2. Clean or otherwise transform the fetched data (e.g., converting temperatures
   from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa), so that the data suits our
   purpose.
3. Push the transformed data to the weather dashboard.

As such, we need to make sure that this implicit task order is also enforced
when running this data process.

##### Data pipelines as graphs

One way to make dependencies between tasks more explicit is to draw the data
pipeline as a _directed graph_.

<Figure src="/media/weather-data-pipeline-graph.png" alt="TODO">
  Graph representation of the data pipeline for the weather dashboard. Nodes
  represent tasks and directed edges represent dependencies between tasks (with
  an edge pointing from task A to task B, indicating that task A needs to be run
  before task B).
</Figure>

This type of graph is typically called a _directed acyclic graph (DAG)_, as the
graph contains directed edges and does not contain any loops or cycles
(acyclic). This acyclic property is extremely important, as it prevents us from
running into circular dependencies between tasks (where task A depends on task B
and vice versa). This logical inconsistency leads to a deadlock type of
situation, in which neither task 2 nor 3 can run, preventing us from executing
the graph.

The acyclic property of DAGs is used by Airflow (and many other workflow
managers) to efficiently resolve and execute these graphs of tasks.

##### Executing a pipeline graph

A nice property of this DAG representation is that it provides a relatively
straightforward algorithm that we can use for running the pipeline.
Conceptually, this algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. For each open (= uncompleted) task in the graph, do the following: – For each
   edge pointing toward the task, check if the “upstream” task on the other end
   of the edge has been completed. – If all upstream tasks have been completed,
   add the task under consideration to a queue of tasks to be executed.
2. Execute the tasks in the execution queue, marking them completed once they
   finish performing their work.
3. Jump back to step 1 and repeat until all tasks in the graph have been
   completed.

##### Pipeline graphs vs. sequential scripts

To build a pipeline for training the ML model, we need to implement something
like the following steps:

1. Prepare the sales data by doing the following:
   - Fetching the sales data from the source system
   - Cleaning/transforming the sales data to fit requirements
2. Prepare the weather data by doing the following:
   - Fetching the weather forecast data from an API
   - Cleaning/transforming the weather data to fit requirements
3. Combine the sales and weather data sets to create the combined data set that
   can be used as input for creating a predictive ML model.
4. Train the ML model using the combined data set.
5. Deploy the ML model so that it can be used by the business.

  sales data are used to train a model that predicts future sales demands
  depending on weather forecasts.
</Figure>

One important difference from our previous example is that the first steps of
this pipeline are in fact independent of each other, as they involve two
separate data sets. This is clearly illustrated by the two separate branches in
the graph representation of the pipeline, which can be executed in parallel if
we apply our graph execution algorithm, making better use of available resources
and potentially decreasing the running time of a pipeline compared to executing
the tasks sequentially.

Another useful property of the graph-based representation is that it clearly
separates pipelines into small incremental tasks rather than having one
monolithic script or process that does all the work. Although having a single
monolithic script may not initially seem like that much of a problem, it can
introduce some inefficiencies when tasks in the pipeline fail, as we would have
to rerun the entire script. In contrast, in the graph representation, we need
only to rerun any failing tasks (and any downstream dependencies).

##### Running pipeline using workflow managers

The challenge of running graphs of dependent tasks is hardly a new problem in
computing. Over the years, many so-called “workflow management” solutions have
been developed to tackle this problem, which generally allow you to define and
execute graphs of tasks as workflows or pipelines.

Although each of these workflow managers has its own strengths and weaknesses,
they all provide similar core functionality that allows you to define and run
pipelines containing multiple tasks with dependencies.

One of the key differences between these tools is how they define their
workflows. For example, tools such as Oozie use static (XML) files to define
workflows, which provides legible workflows but limited flexibility. Other
solutions such as Luigi and Airflow allow you to define workflows as code, which
provides greater flexibility but can be more challenging to read and test
(depending on the coding skills of the person implementing the workflow).

Other key differences lie in the extent of features provided by the workflow
manager. For example, tools such as Make and Luigi do not provide built-in
support for scheduling workflows, meaning that you’ll need an extra tool like
Cron if you want to run your workflow on a recurring schedule. Other tools may
provide extra functionality such as scheduling, monitoring, user-friendly web
interfaces, and so on built into the platform, meaning that you don’t have to
stitch together multiple tools yourself to get these features.

All in all, picking the right workflow management solution for your needs will
require some careful consideration of the key features of the different
solutions and how they fit your requirements.

#### Introducing Airflow

##### Defining pipelines flexibly in (Python) code

In Airflow, you define your DAGs using Python code in DAG files, which are
essentially Python scripts that describe the structure of the corresponding DAG.

One advantage of defining Airflow DAGs in Python code is that this programmatic
approach provides you with a lot of flexibility for building DAGs. For example,
as we will see later in this book, you can use Python code to dynamically
generate optional tasks depending on certain conditions or even generate entire
DAGs based on external metadata or configuration files. This flexibility gives a
great deal of customization in how you build your pipelines, allowing you to fit
Airflow to your needs for building arbitrarily complex pipelines.

<Figure src="/media/airflow-dag-file.png" alt="TODO">
  Airflow pipelines are defined as DAGs using Python code in DAG files. Each DAG
  file typically defines one DAG, which describes the different tasks and their
  dependencies. Besides this, the DAG also defines a schedule interval that
  determines when the DAG is executed by Airflow.
</Figure>

##### Scheduling and executing pipelines

Airflow allows you to define a schedule interval for each DAG, which determines
exactly when your pipeline is run by Airflow. This way, you can tell Airflow to
execute your DAG every hour, every day, every week, and so on, or even use more
complicated schedule intervals based on Cron-like expressions.

At a high level, Airflow is organized into three main components:

- _The Airflow scheduler_—Parses DAGs, checks their schedule interval, and (if
  the DAGs’ schedule has passed) starts scheduling the DAGs’ tasks for execution
  by passing them to the Airflow workers.
- _The Airflow workers_—Pick up tasks that are scheduled for execution and
  execute them. As such, the workers are responsible for actually “doing the
  work.”
- _The Airflow webserver_—Visualizes the DAGs parsed by the scheduler and
  provides the main interface for users to monitor DAG runs and their results.

</Figure>

<Figure src="/media/airflow-process-involved.png" alt="TODO">

  pipelines as DAGs using Airflow.
</Figure>

Once tasks have been queued for execution, they are picked up by a pool of
Airflow workers that execute tasks in parallel and track their results. These
results are communicated to Airflow’s metastore so that users can track the
progress of tasks and view their logs using the Airflow web interface (provided
by the Airflow webserver).

##### Monitoring and handling failures

  DAGs and their recent results.

<Figure src="/media/airflow-graph-view.png" alt="TODO">

  an individual DAG and the dependencies between these tasks.
</Figure>

<Figure src="/media/airflow-tree-view.png" alt="TODO">
  Airflow’s tree view, showing the results of multiple runs of the umbrella
  sales model DAG (most recent + historical runs). The columns show the status
  of one execution of the DAG and the rows show the status of all executions of
  a single task. Colors (which you can see in the e-book version) indicate the
  result of the corresponding task. Users can also click on the task “squares”
  for more details about a given task instance, or to reset the state of a task
  so that it can be rerun by Airflow, if desired.
</Figure>

By default, Airflow can handle failures in tasks by retrying them a couple of
times (optionally with some wait time in between), which can help tasks recover
from any intermittent failures. If retries don’t help, Airflow will record the
task as being failed, optionally notifying you about the failure if configured
to do so. Debugging task failures is pretty straightforward, as the tree view
allows you to see which tasks failed and dig into their logs. The same view also
enables you to clear the results of individual tasks to rerun them (together
with any tasks that depend on that task), allowing you to easily rerun any tasks
after you make changes to their code.

##### Incremental loading and backfilling

This property of Airflow’s schedule intervals is invaluable for implementing
efficient data pipelines, as it allows you to build incremental data pipelines.
In these incremental pipelines, each DAG run processes only data for the
corresponding time slot (the data’s _delta_) instead of having to reprocess the
entire data set every time.

Schedule intervals become even more powerful when combined with the concept of
_backfilling_, which allows you to execute a new DAG for historical schedule
intervals that occurred in the past. This feature allows you to easily create
(or _backfill_) new data sets with historical data simply by running your DAG
for these past schedule intervals.Moreover, by clearing the results of past
runs, you can also use this Airflow feature to easily rerun any historical tasks
if you make changes to your task code, allowing you to easily reprocess an
entire data set when needed.

#### When to use Airflow

##### Reasons to choose Airflow

Several key features that make Airflow ideal for implementing batch-oriented
data pipelines:

- The ability to implement pipelines using Python code allows you to create
  arbitrarily complex pipelines using anything you can dream up in Python.
- The Python foundation of Airflow makes it easy to extend and add integrations
  with many different systems. In fact, the Airflow community has already
  developed a rich collection of extensions that allow Airflow to integrate with
  many different types of databases, cloud services, and so on.
- Rich scheduling semantics allow you to run your pipelines at regular intervals
  and build efficient pipelines that use incremental processing to avoid
  expensive recomputation of existing results.
- Features such as backfilling enable you to easily (re)process historical data,
  allowing you to recompute any derived data sets after making changes to your
  code.
- Airflow’s rich web interface provides an easy view for monitoring the results
  of your pipeline runs and debugging any failures that may have occurred.

An additional advantage of Airflow is that it is open source, which guarantees
that you can build your work on Airflow without getting stuck with any vendor
lock-in.

##### Reasons not to choose Airflow

Some use cases that are not a good fit for Airflow include the following:

- Handling streaming pipelines, as Airflow is primarily designed to run
  recurring or batch-oriented tasks, rather than streaming workloads.
- Implementing highly dynamic pipelines, in which tasks are added/removed
  between every pipeline run. Although Airflow can implement this kind of
  dynamic behavior, the web interface will only show tasks that are still
  defined in the most recent version of the DAG. As such, Airflow favors
  pipelines that do not change in structure every time they run.
- Teams with little or no (Python) programming experience, as implementing DAGs
  in Python can be daunting with little Python experience. In such teams, using
  a workflow manager with a graphical interface (such as Azure Data Factory) or
  a static workflow definition may make more sense.
- Similarly, Python code in DAGs can quickly become complex for larger use
  cases. As such, implementing and maintaining Airflow DAGs require proper
  engineering rigor to keep things maintainable in the long run.

Also, Airflow is primarily a workflow/pipeline management platform and does not
(currently) include more extensive features such as maintaining data lineages,
data versioning, and so on. Should you require these features, you’ll probably
need to look at combining Airflow with other specialized tools that provide
those capabilities.
