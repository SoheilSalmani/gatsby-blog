## App Framework

### What are apps?

Apps are packages that simplify customization and integration by modifying your
space. An app can help adapt Contentful to individual business processes and
integrate with other services.

With the App Framework, we give you the tools to build apps that can customize
Contentful to fit your user and business needs.

### What can apps do?

Using apps, a huge variety of enhancements to the Contentful web app are
possible. From small field editor improvements to deeply integrated full-page
applications, the App Framework makes customizing the web app effortless.

Some common use cases are:

- Adding custom field editors to improve the editor experience
- Managing content versions for running A/B tests on structured content using
  personalization tools
- Triggering actions such as CI builds in third-party systems
- Tailor the default entry editor to suit your specific needs

### Anatomy of an app

#### Frontend apps

Front end apps are single-page applications rendered within an iFrame in six
different locations of the Contentful web app:

- Entry Field
- Entry Sidebar
- Entry Editor
- Page
- App Configuration
- Dialog

You can enable or disable these locations individually via the app definition.

Apps can be customized based on location and context within the Contentful web
app. This allows for a seamless integration with the editing experience. Hosting
apps is as simple as hosting static files -- no code has to run on your servers.
The only requirement is that files must be accessible via URL by users of the
Contentful web app.

#### Backend apps

In addition to providing a customized user interface with controls or dashboards
within the Contentful web app, apps can also perform asynchronous work on a
server without any user interaction. These apps are running on your servers and
their behavior is therefore fully under your control. With app identities and
events, apps can interact with the Contentful Content Management API with their
own identity. Apps can individually subscribe to events within their installed
environment, in a manner similar to webhooks. The big advantage of backend apps
compared to using regular webhooks and CMA tokens is, that app identities are
not user bound and therefore not restricted to a specific user account's
permissions. Also, the frontend and backend configuration comes as a bundle and
can be installed into an environment with a single click without manual setup of
webhooks filters or updating the backend code for new environments.

### Managing and distributing apps

#### Private apps

A private app is built by you for your specific organization's needs to optimize
your organization's editorial experience. It is fully under your control and not
accessible by other organizations. Apps are created within your organization and
installed into one or more environments, each with the ability to be
individually configured. The total number of apps and installations within your
organization/environment is limited based on your Contentful plan

#### Marketplace apps

Marketplace apps are built by our technology partners and connect Contentful
with other systems allowing you to assemble the stack of your choice.
Marketplace apps can be installed free of charge from within the Contentful web
app without touching a single line of code. Many of them are open source apps,
so if you are interested in how these apps were built, feel free to check out
our apps repository. Currently, Contentfulâ€™s Marketplace is open to only a
select group of technology and integration partners.
