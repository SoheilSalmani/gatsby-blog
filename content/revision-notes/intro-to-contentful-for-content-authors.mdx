## What is Contentful

Contentful is not a content management system (CMS). Contentful is **content
infrastructure**.

Contentful separates the front-end from the back-end. It also provides users
with a framework for organizing and defining the relationships between their
types of content.

## Contentful for Content Authors

### What's in it for you?

1. Reusable content - create, store, and update content all in one place and
   watch as it changes everywhere without copying/pasting
2. Customizable - tailor your experience to work for you by setting up custom
   widgets that integrate with the tools you already use
3. Content moderation - customize your workflow and approval processes for your
   team members with roles & permissions
4. Independence - add or change content without having to bug your development
   team
5. Version control - see earlier published versions of your content and roll
   back instantly
6. Flexible localization - easily manage country-specific or audience-specific
   text and images

### Where will you be working?

As a content author, you will potentially be working in three main applications:

1. **The Contentful Web App (aka web app)** - This is where you will probably be
   working most of the time, especially if you need to create content that will
   be published on multiple channels.
2. **Compose** - This is a streamlined, flattened version of the Contentful web
   app that focuses on creating pages of content for more web-centric projects.
   Compose provides a simpler editorial experience for content authors than the
   web app.
3. **Launch** - This is where you will manage, schedule, and track the bulk
   publishing of groups of content or individual pieces of content.
