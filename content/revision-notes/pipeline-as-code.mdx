## Getting Started with Jenkins

### What's CI/CD

#### Defining Continuous Integration

- **Unit Tests:** Test each piece of the source code. They consist of testing
  individual functions and methods. You could also output your test coverage and
  validate that you're meeting your code coverage requirements.
- **Quality Tests:** Check that the code is well-formatted, follows best
  practices, and has no serious coding errors. This is also called static code
  analysis, as it helps to produce high-quality code by looking for patterns in
  code that might generate bugs.
- **Security Tests:** Inspect source code to uncover common security
  vulnerabilities and common security flaws (for eg: leaked usernames and
  passwords).
- **UI Tests:** Simulate user behavior through the system to ensure the
  application works correctly in all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox,
  Internet Explorer, etc) and platforms (Windows, Linux, OS X, etc) and that it
  delivers the functionally promised in the user stories.
- **Integrations Tests:** Checks that different services or components used by
  the application work well together and there are no defects. For example, it
  can be testing the interaction with the database.

#### Defining Continuous Deployments

Continuous deployment (CD) is an extension of continuous integration. Every
change that passes all stages of your continuous integration pipeline is
released automatically to your staging/pre-production environment. In such a
process, there's no need to decide what will be deployed and when. The pipeline
will automatically deploy whatever build components/packages successfully exit
the pipeline.

#### Defining Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery (CD) is similar to continuous deployment but requires human
intervention or a business decision before deploying the release to production.
