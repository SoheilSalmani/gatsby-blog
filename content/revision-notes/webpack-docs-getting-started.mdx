## Basic Setup

```shell
mkdir webpack-demo
cd webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

```js nu fp=src/index.js
function component() {
  const element = document.createElement("div")

  // Lodash, currently included via a script, is required for this line to work
  element.innerHTML = _.join(["Hello", "webpack"], " ")

  return element
}

document.body.appendChild(component())
```

```js nu fp=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.17.20"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./src/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, there are implicit dependencies between the `<script>` tags.

There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:

- It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
- If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application
  will not function properly.
- If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to
  download unnecessary code.

## Creating a Bundle

The "source" code (`./src`) from our "distribution" code (`./dist`). The
"source" code is the code that we'll write and edit. The "distribution" code is
the minimized and optimized output of our build process that will eventually be
loaded in the browser.

To bundle the `lodash` dependency with `index.js`, we'll need to install the
library locally:

```shell
npm install --save lodash
```

```diff nu fp=src/index.js
+import _ from 'lodash';
+
 function component() {
   const element = document.createElement('div');

-  // Lodash, currently included via a script, is required for this line to work
+  // Lodash, now imported by this script
   element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');

   return element;
 }

 document.body.appendChild(component());
```

```diff nu fp=dist/index.html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" />
     <title>Getting Started</title>
-    <script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.17.20"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
-    <script src="./src/index.js"></script>
+    <script src="main.js"></script>
   </body>
 </html>
```

In this setup, `index.js` explicitly requires lodash to be present, and binds it
as `_` (no global scope pollution). By stating what dependencies a module needs,
webpack can use this information to build a dependency graph. It then uses the
graph to generate an optimized bundle where scripts will be executed in the
correct order.

With that said, let's run `npx webpack`, which will take our script at
`src/index.js` as the **entry point**, and will generate `dist/main.js` as the
**output**. The `npx` command runs the webpack binary
(`./node_modules/.bin/webpack`) of the webpack package we installed in the
beginning.

## Modules

The `import` and `export` statements have been standardized in ES2015. They are
supported in most of the browsers at this moment, however there are some
browsers that don't recognize the new syntax. But don't worry, webpack does
support them out of the box.

Behind the scenes, webpack actually "transpiles" the code so that older browsers
can also run it. Besides import and export, webpack supports various other
module syntaxes as well.

Note that webpack will not alter any code other than `import` and `export`
statements. If you are using other ES2015 features, make sure to use a
transpiler such as Babel or Bubl√© via webpack's loader system.
