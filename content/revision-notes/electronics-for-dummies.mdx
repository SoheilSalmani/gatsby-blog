## Fathoming the Fundamentals of Electronics

### Introducing Your to Electronics

#### Just What Is Electronics?

_Electronic systems_ control the current, switching it on and off, changing its
fluctuations, direction, and timing in various ways to accomplish a variety of
functions.

The word _electronics_ describes both the field of study that focuses on the
control of electrical energy and the physical systems (including circuits,
components, and interconnections) that implement this control of electrical
energy.

- **Electric charge:** A fundamental property of certain particles that
  describes how they interact with each other. There are two types of electric
  charges: positive and negative. Particles of the same type (positive-positive
  or negative-negative) repel each other, and particles of the opposite type
  (positive-negative) attract each other.
- **Electrical energy:** A form of energy caused by the behavior of electrically
  charged particles. This is what you pay your electric company to supply.
- **Electric current:** The movement, or flow, of electrically charged
  particles.

#### Checking Out Electric Current

_Electric current_, sometimes known as electricity, is the movement in the same
direction of microscopically small, electrically charged particles called
electrons.

##### Exploring an atom

_Atoms_ are the basic building blocks of everything in the universe.

Every atom contains the following types of subatomic particles:

- **Protons** carry a positive electric charge and exist inside the _nucleus_,
  or center, of the atom.
- **Neutrons** have no electric charge, and exist along with protons inside the
  nucleus.
- **Electrons** carry a negative electric charge and are located outside the
  nucleus in an _electron cloud_. Some are closer to the nucleus than others.

##### Getting a charge out of protons and electrons

_Electric charge_ is a property of certain particles, such as electrons,
protons, and quarks that describes how they interact with each other. There are
two different types of electric charge, somewhat arbitrarily named positive and
negative. In general, particles carrying the same type of charge repel each
other, whereas particles carrying opposite charges attract each other. Within
each atom, the protons inside the nucleus attract the electrons that are outside
the nucleus.

Under normal circumstances, every atom has an equal number of protons and
electrons, and the atom is said to be _electrically neutral_.

The electrons closest to the nucleus are held to the atom with a stronger force
than the electrons farther from the nucleus; some atoms hold on to their outer
electrons with a vengeance, while others are a bit more lax.

##### Identifying conductors and insulators

Materials containing loosely bound outer electrons are called _electrical
conductors_, or simply _conductors_.

Materials that tend to keep their electrons close to home are classified as
_electrical insulators_.

In conductors, the outer electrons of each atom are bound so loosely that many
of them break free and jump around from atom to atom. But if you give these free
electrons a bit of a push in one direction, they will quickly get organized and
move together in the direction of the push.

##### Mobilizing electrons to create current

Electric current (often called electricity) is the displacement of a large
number of electrons in the same direction through a conductor when an external
force (or push) is applied. That external force is known as _voltage_.

The strength of an electric current is defined by how many charge carriers
(usually electrons) pass a fixed point in one second, and is measured in units
called amperes, or amps (abbreviated as A). One ampere is defined to be
$6.241 \times 10^{18}$ electrons per second. The symbol $I$ is used to represent
the strength of an electric current.

The term _coulomb_ is used to describe the magnitude of the charge carried by
$6.241 \times 10^{18}$ electrons. A coulomb is related to an amp in that one
coulomb is the amount of charge carried by one amp of current in one second.

A _milliamp_ (abbreviated mA) is one one-thousandth of an amp, or 0.001 amp. (In
scientific notation, a milliamp is $1 \times 10^{-3}$ amp.)

#### Understanding Voltage

##### Let the force be with you

The force that pushes electrons along is technically called an _electromotive
force_ (abbreviated _EMF_ or $E$), but it is more commonly known as _voltage_
(abbreviated $V$). You measure voltage by using units called (conveniently)
volts (abbreviated V).

##### Why voltage needs to be different

A _voltage_ is simply a difference in electrical charge between two points. In a
battery, negatively charged atoms (atoms with an abundance of electrons) build
up on one of two metal plates, and positively charged atoms (atoms with a dearth
of electrons) build up on the other metal plate, creating a voltage across the
plates. If you provide a conductive path between the metal plates, you enable
excess electrons to travel from one plate to the other, and current will flow in
an effort to neutralize the charges. The electromotive force that compels
current to flow when the circuit is completed is created by the difference
between charges at the battery terminals.

You may also hear the terms _potential difference_, _voltage potential_,
_potential drop_, or _voltage drop_ used to describe voltage. The word
_potential_ refers to the possibility that a current may flow if you complete
the circuit, and the words _drop_ and _difference_ both refer to the difference
in charge that creates the voltage.
