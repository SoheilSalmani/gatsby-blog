## Getting Started

### Writing, Compiling, and Executing Your Hello World Program

Exercise 1:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

All programs in Java are called classes. A program might consist of several
**classes**. For a class to be executable in Java, it must contain a method
called `main`.

- `static` signifies that there is nothing in the system instantiating the
  `main` method. Because of the way the Java Virtual Machine works, the `main`
  method needs to be static, or it will not be possible to execute it.
- `void` indicates that the `main` method will not be returning anything to any
  code calling it.
- `String[] args`: Parameters are passed as a list of strings. In the particular
  case of the main method, these are strings that could be entered on the
  **command-line interface (CLI)** when calling the program.

#### Variables and Variable Types

Exercise 2:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String t = "This is a text";
        char c = 'A';
        int i = 53;
        float f = 23.08f;
        double d = 1.97;
        boolean b = true;
        System.out.println(t);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(i);
        System.out.println(f);
        System.out.println(d);
        System.out.println(b);
    }
}
```

#### Primitive versus Reference Data Types

Some data types are built on top of others.

The eight primitive data types represent **truth levels** (`boolean`),
**integral numbers** (`byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`), **floating point
numbers** (`float` and `double`), and **characters** (`char`).

**Note:** String is not a primitive data type. It is what we call a reference
data type. A mnemotechnic that could help you remember why it is called
"reference" is that it is not linking to the actual data, but to the position in
memory where the data is stored; hence, it is "a reference.".

#### Null

In the same way that primitive data types have a default value, reference data
types, which could be made of any kind of data, have a common way to express
that they contain no data. As an example of a reference typed variable, the
default value for a string that is defined as empty is `null`.

Null is a lot more complex than that, though—it can also be used to determine
termination. Continuing with the example of the string, when stored in memory,
it will be made of an array of characters ending with `null`.

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String t;
        System.out.println(t);
        t = "Joe ...";
        System.out.println(t);
        t = "went fishing";
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}
```

#### Chars and Strings

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String t = "";
        System.out.println(t);
        t = "Joe ...";
        System.out.println(t);
        t = "went fishing";
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}
```

#### Doing Some Math

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        float f = 51.49f;
        System.out.println(f);
        int i = Math.round(f);
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```

`Math.round()` and `System.out.println()` are examples of calls to methods that
belong to the standard Java libraries `Math` and `System`, respectively.

Exercise 4:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double a = 3;
        double b = 4;
        double h = 0;
        h = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2));
        System.out.println(h);
    }
}
```

#### Comments Help You to Share Code

Comments: `//` and `/* */`.

#### CLI versus GUI

Exercise 5:

1. In IntelliJ IDEA, click on <Scr>Build Project</Scr>.
2. ```shell
   cd out/production/HelloWorld/
   java Main
   ```

Activity 1:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double a = 3;
        double b = 4;
        double m = 0;
        String r = "The minimum of numbers: " + a + " and " + b + " is ";
        m = Math.min(a, b);
        System.out.println(r + m);
    }
}
```

## Learning the Basics

### Controlling the Flow of Your Programs

Exercise 1:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean happy = true;
        boolean sad = false;
        if (happy)
            System.out.println("I am happy.");
        if (sad) {
            System.out.println("The variable sad is true.");
        }

    }
}
```

#### Comparison Operators

Exercise 2:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int maxDistance = 10;
        int distanceToHome = 11;
        if (distanceToHome > maxDistance) {
            System.out.println("That is too far for free delivery.");
        }
        if (distanceToHome <= maxDistance) {
            System.out.println("You get free delivery!");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Nested if Statements

Exercise 3:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int speed = 75;
        int maxSpeed = 60;
        int speedForFine = 70;
        if (speed >= maxSpeed) {
            System.out.println("You're over the speed limit");
            if (speed >= speedForFine) {
                System.out.println("You are eligible for a fine!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Branching Two Ways with if and else

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
if (speed > maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Your speed is greater than the max. speed limit");
} else if (speed < maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Your speed is less than the max. speed limit");
} else {
    System.out.println("Your speed is equal to the max. speed limit");
}
```

Exercise 4:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int smallDiscount = 0;
        int mediumDiscount = 10;
        int largeDiscount = 15;
        int mediumThreshold = 5;
        int largeThreshold = 50;
        int purchaseAmount = 40;
        if (purchaseAmount >= largeThreshold) {
            System.out.println("You get a discount of " + largeDiscount + "%");
        } else if (purchaseAmount >= mediumThreshold) {
            System.out.println("You get a discount of " + mediumDiscount + "%");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You get a discount of " + noDiscount + "%");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using Complex Conditionals

Exercise 5:

```java nu fp=src/Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 30;
        int bpm = 150;
        if (age == 30) {
            if (bpm >= 95 && bpm <= 162) {
                System.out.println("Heart rate is normal.");
            } else if (bpm < 95) {
                System.out.println("Heart rate is very low.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Heart rate is very high.");
            }
        } else if (age == 60) {
            if (bpm >= 80 && bpm <= 136) {
                System.out.println("Heart rate is normal.");
            } else if (bpm < 80) {
                System.out.println("Heart rate is very low.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Heart rate is very high.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
