## Variables and Operators

### Introduction

A massive shift in computer performance has taken place. Going fast now means
you need to be able to do as much work parallel or concurrently as possible.
This change is due to the design of modern CPUs, which emphasize more cores over
high clock speed. None of the currently popular programming languages have been
designed to take advantage of this fact, which makes writing parallel and
concurrent code in them error-prone. Go is designed to take advantage of
multiple CPU cores, and it removes all the frustration and bug-filled code. Go
is designed to allow any developer to easily and safely write parallel and
concurrent code that enables them to take advantage of modern multicore CPUs and
cloud computing – unlocking high-performance processing and massive scalability
without the drama.

### What Does Go Look Like?

```go
package main
```

This code is our package declaration. All Go files must start with one of these.
If you want to run the code directly, you'll need to name it `main`. If you
don't name it `main`, then you can use it as a library and import it into other
Go code. All Go files in the same directory are considered part of the same
package, which means all the files must have the same package name.

```go
// Import extra functionality from packages
import (
        "errors"
        "fmt"
        "log"
        "math/rand"
        "strconv"
        "time"
)
```

The packages are all from Go's standard library. Go's standard library is very
high-quality and comprehensive. You are strongly recommended to maximize your
use of it. You can tell if a package isn't from the standard library because
it'll look like a URL.

```go
var helloList = []string{
        "Hello, world",
        "Καλημέρα κόσμε",
        "こんにちは世界",
        "سلام دنیا‎",
        "Привет, мир",
}
```

There are three types of lists in Go: slices, arrays, and maps.

```go
func main() {
        // Seed random number generator using the current time
        rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
        // Generate a random number in the range of out list
        index := rand.Intn(len(helloList))
        // Call a function and receive multiple return values
        msg, err := hello(index)
        // Handle any errors
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
        // Print our message to the console
        fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

The `main()` function is the entry point of your Go code.

To get the time, we call the `Now` function in the `time` package. The `Now`
function returns a struct type variable. Structs are a collection of properties
and functions, a little like objects in other languages.

The `:=` notation, which is a very popular shortcut in Go. It tells the compiler
to go ahead and assign that value to my variable and select the appropriate type
for that value. This shortcut is one of the many things that makes Go feel like
a dynamically typed language.

```go
func hello(index int) (string, error) {
        if index < 0 || index > len(helloList)-1 {
                // Create an error, convert the int type to a string
                return "", errors.New("out of range: " + strconv.Itoa(index))
        }
        return helloList[index], nil
}
```

Having an `error `as your last return value is a very common thing to have in
Go.

In Go, `nil` represents something with no value and no type.

Exercise 1.01:

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
        "strings"
        "time"
)

func main() {
        rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
        r := rand.Intn(5) + 1
        stars := strings.Repeat("*", r)
        fmt.Println(stars)
}
```

Activity 1.01:

```go nu
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        firstName := "Bob"
        familyName := "Smith"
        age := 34
        peanutAllergy := false

        fmt.Println(firstName)
        fmt.Println(familyName)
        fmt.Println(age)
        fmt.Println(peanutAllergy)
}
```

### Declaring a Variable Using var

Using `var` is the foundational way to declare a variable. Every other way we'll
cover is a variation of this approach, typically by omitting parts of this
definition. A full `var` definition with everything in place looks like this:

```go
var foo string = "bar"
```

Exercise 1.02:

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
)

// Package level variable
var foo string = "bar"

func main() {
        // Function level variable
        var baz string = "qux"

        fmt.Println(foo, baz)
}
```

### Declaring Multiple Variables at Once with var

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

var (
        Debug       bool      = false
        LogLevel    string    = "info"
        startUpTime time.Time = time.Now()
)

func main() {
        fmt.Println(Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime)
}
```

### Skipping the Type or Value When Declaring Variables

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

var (
        Debug       bool
        LogLevel    = "info"
        startUpTime = time.Now()
)

func main() {
        fmt.Println(Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime)
}
```

### Type Inference Gone Wrong

```go nu
package main

import "math/rand"

func main() {
        var seed = 1234456789 // Add int64
        rand.Seed(seed)
}
```

### Short Variable Declaration

When declaring variables in functions and functions only, we can use the `:=`
shorthand. This shorthand allows us to make our declarations even shorter. It
does this by allowing us to not have to use the `var` keyword and by always
inferring the type from a required initial value.

Exercise 1.05:

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

func main() {
        Debug := false
        LogLevel := "info"
        startUpTime := time.Now()
        fmt.Println(Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime)
}
```

### Declaring Multiple Variables with a Short Variable Declaration

Exercise 1.06:

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

func getConfig() (bool, string, time.Time) {
        return false, "info", time.Now()
}

func main() {
        Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime := getConfig()
        fmt.Println(Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime)
}
```

If we used the `var` notation, it would look like this:

```go
var (
        Debug bool
        LogLevel string
        startUpTime time.Time
)
Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime = getConfig()
```

### Using var to Declare Multiple Variables in One Line

While it's more common to use a short variable declaration, you can use `var` to
define multiple variables on a single line. One limitation of this is that, when
declaring the type, all the values must have the same type. If you use an
initial value, then each value infers its type from the literal value so that
they can differ.

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

func getConfig() (bool, string, time.Time) {
        return false, "info", time.Now()
}

func main() {
        // Type only
        var start, middle, end float32
        fmt.Println(start, middle, end)

        // Initial value mixed type
        var name, left, right, top, bottom = "one", 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5
        fmt.Println(name, left, right, top, bottom)

        // Works with functions also
        var Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime = getConfig()
        fmt.Println(Debug, LogLevel, startUpTime)
}
```

### Non-English Variable Names

There are some limitations regarding what the name of a variable can be. The
first character of the name must be a letter or `_`. The rest can be a mixture
of letters, numbers, and `_`.

```go nu
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

func main() {
        デバッグ := false
        日志级别 := "info"
        ይጀምሩ := time.Now()
        _A1_Μείγμα := ""
        fmt.Println(デバッグ, 日志级别, ይጀምሩ, _A1_Μείγμα)
}
```

### Changing the Value of a Variable

Exercise 1.07:

```go nu
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        offset := 5
        fmt.Println(offset)
        offset = 10
        fmt.Println(offset)
}
```

```go nu
package main

import "fmt"

var defaultOffset = 10

func main() {
        offset := defaultOffset
        fmt.Println(offset)
        offset = offset + defaultOffset
        fmt.Println(offset)
}
```

### Changing Multiple Values at Once

Exercise 1.08:

```go nu
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        query, limit, offset := "bat", 10, 0
        query, limit, offset = "ball", offset, 20
        fmt.Println(query, limit, offset)
}
```
