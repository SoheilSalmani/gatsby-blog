## Understanding the Fundamentals of Amazon Web Services

### Accessing AWS Services

Users can access AWS services in multiple ways:

- **AWS Management Console:** This is a simple to use, browser-based graphical
  user interface that customers can use to manage their AWS resources.
- The **AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI):** This is mostly used by system
  administrators to perform day-to-day administration activities. There are
  individual sets of commands available for each AWS service.
- **AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs):** AWS helps the user reduce the
  complexity of coding by providing SDKs for a number of programming languages,
  including Android, iOS, Java, Python, PHP, .NET, Node.js, Go, and Ruby. These
  SDKs can be used to create custom applications to meet specific organizational
  needs.
- **Query APIs:** AWS provides a number of HTTP endpoints. These endpoints can
  be used to send HTTP requests, such as GET and PUT, in order to acquire the
  present status and any other information for various AWS resources.

### An overview of AWS

#### Regions and AZs

Each region is a collection of at least two or more **availability zones
(AZs)**. The regions are independent and isolated from each other in order to
keep them safe from catastrophic events.

Each AZ is separated based on a metropolitan area within a region, but they are
internally connected to each other through dedicated low-latency networks within
the same region to provide failover architecture.

#### What are SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS?

- **IaaS:** This is when a service provider offers virtualized hardware or
  computing infrastructure as a service.
- **PaaS:** PaaS is a type of cloud service in which a service provider offers
  application platforms and tools over the cloud, usually to enable application
  development. In this service model, the underlying hardware and software is
  hosted on the service provider's infrastructure.
- **SaaS:** In the SaaS model, the service provider offers software or
  applications as services. Such services are hosted by the providers and the
  end customer simply consumes this SaaS without worrying about the underlying
  hosting platform, infrastructure, and maintenance.

#### Understanding virtualization

Virtualization is a process of virtually segregating physical hardware resources
into a set of virtual resources that can independently work as a computing
resource and provide customized and dedicated CPU, RAM, or storage. Each server
and its resources are created in an isolated environment. Each isolated
environment is abstracted from the physical OS and underlying hardware
configuration. Such resources are called VMs or instances.

Virtualization is achieved by using virtualization software that maintains the
abstract and virtual layers on top of physical hardware.

#### Virtualization types based on virtualization software

- **Class 1 type:** This is also known as the bare-metal virtualization type. A
  very thin (that is, of a small size) virtualization software called a
  hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. Class 1 hypervisors
  are faster than class 2 hypervisors. Some examples of class 1 hypervisors are
  Xen, Hyper-V, KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine), and vSphere. The AWS cloud
  uses a customized Xen hypervisor and KVM.
- **Class 2 type:** This is also called a hosted hypervisor. These types of
  hypervisors are installed above the base OS, such as Windows or Linux.
  Examples of class 2 hypervisors include VMware workstation, VirtualBox, and
  virtual PC.

#### Virtualization types based on virtualization methods

- **OS-level virtualization:** In this type of virtualization, host machines and
  VMs have the same OS with the same patch level.
- **Software virtualization (hypervisor):** This method of virtualization can be
  split into three categories, as follows:
  - **Binary translation:** In this virtualization, sensitive instructions from
    VMs are replaced by hypervisor calls.
  - **Para Virtualization Mode (PVM):** In this virtualization, the guest OS is
    modified in order to deliver performance.
  - **Hardware Assisted Virtual Machine (HVM):** This method of virtualization
    creates an abstract layer between the host and guest VMs. It uses special
    CPU instruction sets (that is, Intel-VT and AMD-V) to boost the performance
    of guest VMs.
- **Hardware emulation:** This makes it possible to run an unsupported OS, such
  as running Android on a PC.

### Elasticity versus scalability

- **Scalability:** This means increasing the capacity of an existing instance
  (that is, scale up) or adding more instances in parallel to an existing
  instance (that is, scale out). Scalability is essential in order to achieve
  elasticity:
  - **Scale up:** Changing the instance type from small to large (that is,
    changing to more memory or compute) is called scaling up; it is also called
    **vertical scaling**. It may require stopping the existing and running
    instance. Usually, scaling up is done in order to get more compute and
    memory on the same instance. Scaling up is usually recommended for
    applications that do not support clustering modes easily, such as
    **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**. Usually, scaling up is
    achieved manually and requires downtime.
  - **Scale out:** Placing one or more new instances in parallel to the existing
    instance is called **scale out**. It is also referred to as horizontal
    scaling. It offers good performance and availability as instances can be
    placed across multiple AZs. By having individual resources, such as an NIC
    and disk controller, for each instance, much better performance can be
    achieved compared to scaling up. Usually, scaling out is suggested for
    clustering-enabled applications, such as stateless web servers, big data,
    and NoSQL. Scaling out generally does not require any downtime.
- **Elasticity:** In the cloud infrastructure, elasticity can be defined as the
  ability to automatically provision additional resources to meet high demand
  and reduce the extended number of resources when the demand lowers.

### Creating a new AWS account

#### Root user versus non-root user

Root accounts should not be used for day-to-day activities. It is highly
recommended that you create appropriate **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
users for day-to-day activities, such as database administration, system
administration, and more.

### Deleting an AWS account

AWS provides you with an option to delete or close an AWS account. Be very
careful if you're just checking the interface, as all AWS resources and data are
wiped out when the account is closed. Once the account is closed, there is no
mechanism to undo or get the data back. It is highly recommended that you back
up important data to a secure and safe place before closing your AWS account.

### Core AWS Services

### AWS soft limits

For every AWS account, region-based limits are enabled for each AWS service.
Such limits restrict an AWS account to provision resources up to a specific
limit. For example, AWS imposes a soft limit of around 20 EC2 instances in a new
account. This limit may vary according to resource types and the respective AWS
services. Some of these limits are soft limits, and you can raise a support
request to AWS for revising this limit in your AWS account.
