## Introducing pytest

With `unittest`, you create tests by subclassing from `unittest.TestCase` and
defining methods that begin with `test`.

```python nu
import unittest
from fibo import fibonacci

class Test(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_fibo(self):
        result = fibonacci(4)
        self.assertEqual(result, 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Pytest is a mature and full-featured testing framework, from small tests to
large scale functional tests for applications and libraries alike.

Pytest is simple to get started with. To write tests, you don't need classes;
you can write simple functions that start with `test` and use Python's built-in
`assert` statement:

```python nu
from fibo import fibonacci

def test_fibo():
    assert fibonacci(4) == 3
```

Pytest not only makes it **simple to write tests**, it has many **command-line
options that increase productivity**, such as running just the last failing
tests, or running a specific group of tests by name or because they're specially
marked.

Tests for real-world applications usually need complex setups, such as starting
a background worker, filling up a database, or initializing a GUI. Using pytest,
those complex test resources can be managed by a powerful mechanism called
**fixtures**.

Customization is important, and pytest goes a step further by defining a very
powerful plugin system. Plugins can change several aspects of the test run, from
how tests are executed to providing new fixtures and capabilities to make it
easy to test many types of applications and frameworks. There are plugins that
execute tests in a random order each time to ensure tests are not changing
global state that might affect other tests, plugins that repeat failing tests a
number of times to weed out flaky behavior, plugins that show failures as they
appear instead of only at the end of the run, and plugins that execute tests
across many CPUs to speed up the suite. There are also plugins that are useful
when testing Django, Flask, Twisted, and Qt applications, further plugins for
the acceptance testing of web applications using Selenium.

Pytest runs `unittest` based test suites out of the box and without any
modifications, so you can gradually migrate existing test suites.
