## Configure builds

### Get started

Netlify lets you link a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to a site for
continuous deployment. Each time you push to your Git provider, Netlify runs a
build with your tool of choice and deploys the result to our powerful CDN.

#### Basic build settings

You can specify how Netlify will build your site by going to <Scr>Site settings
| Build & deploy | Continuous Deployment | Build settings</Scr>.

From here, you can link an existing site to a Git repository or change the
currently linked repository, set a base directory, add a build command, and
specify a publish directory.

With continuous deployment, builds are active by default. You can stop or
activate builds at will for more control of your workflow.

You can also specify some of these build settings and others in a configuration
file, which allows you to change your settings depending on the deploy context.
The configuration file settings override build settings specified in the UI.

##### Definitions

- **Base directory:** Optional field for linking monorepos or sites built from a
  subdirectory of a repository. It specifies the directory that our buildbot
  changes to before starting a build. Itâ€™s where our build system checks for
  dependency management files such as `package.json` or `.nvmrc`. If not set,
  the base directory defaults to the root of the repository.
- **Build command**: If you are using a static site generator or other build
  tool, this is where you should specify the command to run to build your site.
  For example, `npm run build`.
- **Publish directory**: Directory (relative to the root of your repo) that
  contains the deploy-ready HTML files and assets generated by the build.
- **Deploy log visibility**: For a site linked to a public repo, the privacy
  level for the deploy logs. The default setting **Public logs** makes deploy
  logs available to anyone with a deploy detail URL. You can limit deploy log
  access to site members by selecting **Private logs**.
- **Active builds**: When builds are active, Netlify builds your site according
  to your continuous deployment settings when you push to your Git provider.
- **Stopped builds**: When builds are stopped, Netlify will never build your
  site. You can build your site locally instead using Netlify CLI and then
  publish new deploys manually with the CLI or the API.
