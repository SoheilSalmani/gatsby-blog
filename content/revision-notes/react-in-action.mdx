## Meet React

### Meet React

#### Meet React

- **Components:** Encapsulated units of functionality that are the primary unit
  in React. They utilize data (_properties_ and _state_) to render your UI as
  output. Certain types of React components also provide a set of lifecycle
  methods that you can hook into. The rendering process (outputting and updating
  a UI based on your data) is predictable in React, and your components can hook
  into it using React’s APIs.
- **React libraries:** React uses a set of core libraries. The core React
  library works with the `react-dom` and `react-native` libraries and is focused
  on component specification and definition. It allows you to build a tree of
  components that a renderer for the browser or another platform can use.
  `react-dom` is one such renderer and is aimed at browser environments and
  serverside rendering. The React Native libraries focus on native platforms and
  let you create React applications for iOS, Android, and other platforms.]
- **Third-party libraries:** React doesn’t come with tools for data modeling,
  HTTP calls, styling libraries, or other common aspects of a frontend
  application. This leaves you free to use additional code, modules, or other
  tools you prefer in your application. And even though these common
  technologies don’t come bundled with React, the broader ecosystem around React
  is full of incredibly useful libraries.
- **Running a React application:** Your React application runs on the platform
  you’re building for. This book focuses on the web platform and builds a
  browser and serverbased application, but other projects like React Native and
  React VR open the possibility of your app running on other platforms.

#### The virtual DOM

A _virtual DOM_ is a data structure or collection of data structures that mimics
or mirrors the Document Object Model that exists in browsers. In general, a
virtual DOM will serve as an intermediate layer between the application code and
the browser DOM.

##### Updates and diffing

React creates and maintains a virtual DOM in memory, and a renderer like
ReactDOM handles updating the browser DOM based on changes. React can perform
intelligent updates and only do work on parts that have changed because it can
use _heuristic diffing_ to calculate which parts of the inmemory DOM require
changes to the DOM. Theoretically, this is much more streamlined and elegant
than “dirty checking” or other more bruteforce approaches, but a major practical
implication is that developers have less complicated state tracking to reason
about.

React’s diffing and update procedure. When a change happens, React determines
differences between the actual and in-memory DOMs. Then it performs an efficient
update to the browser’s DOM. This process is often referred to as a _diff_
(“what changed?”) and _patch_ (“update only what changed”) process.
