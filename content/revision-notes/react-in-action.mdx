## Meet React

### Meet React

#### Meet React

- **Components:** Encapsulated units of functionality that are the primary unit
  in React. They utilize data (_properties_ and _state_) to render your UI as
  output. Certain types of React components also provide a set of lifecycle
  methods that you can hook into. The rendering process (outputting and updating
  a UI based on your data) is predictable in React, and your components can hook
  into it using React’s APIs.
- **React libraries:** React uses a set of core libraries. The core React
  library works with the `react-dom` and `react-native` libraries and is focused
  on component specification and definition. It allows you to build a tree of
  components that a renderer for the browser or another platform can use.
  `react-dom` is one such renderer and is aimed at browser environments and
  serverside rendering. The React Native libraries focus on native platforms and
  let you create React applications for iOS, Android, and other platforms.]
- **Third-party libraries:** React doesn’t come with tools for data modeling,
  HTTP calls, styling libraries, or other common aspects of a frontend
  application. This leaves you free to use additional code, modules, or other
  tools you prefer in your application. And even though these common
  technologies don’t come bundled with React, the broader ecosystem around React
  is full of incredibly useful libraries.
- **Running a React application:** Your React application runs on the platform
  you’re building for. This book focuses on the web platform and builds a
  browser and serverbased application, but other projects like React Native and
  React VR open the possibility of your app running on other platforms.

#### The virtual DOM

A _virtual DOM_ is a data structure or collection of data structures that mimics
or mirrors the Document Object Model that exists in browsers. In general, a
virtual DOM will serve as an intermediate layer between the application code and
the browser DOM.

##### Updates and diffing

React creates and maintains a virtual DOM in memory, and a renderer like
ReactDOM handles updating the browser DOM based on changes. React can perform
intelligent updates and only do work on parts that have changed because it can
use _heuristic diffing_ to calculate which parts of the inmemory DOM require
changes to the DOM. Theoretically, this is much more streamlined and elegant
than “dirty checking” or other more bruteforce approaches, but a major practical
implication is that developers have less complicated state tracking to reason
about.

<Figure src="/media/react-diffing-and-update-procedure.png">

React’s diffing and update procedure. When a change happens, React determines
differences between the actual and in-memory DOMs. Then it performs an efficient
update to the browser’s DOM. This process is often referred to as a _diff_
(“what changed?”) and _patch_ (“update only what changed”) process.

#### Introducing React components

##### Understanding the application data

An API, or, _application programming interface_, is a set of routines and
protocols for building software. That might sound vague, and it is a pretty
general definition. API is a broad term, applying to everything from company
platforms to open source libraries.

In web development and engineering, API has become almost synonymous with a
remote, web-based _public_ API. This means that an API is usually a way of
exposing defined ways to interact with a program or platform, usually over the
internet, and for people to use and consume.

#### Creating components in React

The `prop-types` library is a development library that will help you do some
typechecking on data passed to your components.

##### Creating React elements

React elements are what React DOM will take and use to update the DOM.

<Figure src="/media/react-and-dom.png">
  React elements are what React uses to create a virtual DOM that React DOM will
  manage and use to reconcile and update the actual DOM. They are simple
  blueprints for React to use in creating and managing elements.

##### Property validation via PropTypes

When using `PropTypes`, you need to add a `propTypes` property to the
`React.Component` class via a static class property or by simple property
assignment after the class definition.

```jsx
Post.propTypes = {
  user: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  content: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  id: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
}
```

Because `PropTypes` only does type evaluation in development mode, your app
running in production won’t expend the extra effort to do the work of
`PropTypes`.

#### The life and times of a component

<Figure src="/media/rendering-in-react.png">
  Zooming in on rendering in React. React classes and React elements are used by
  React to create an in-memory virtual DOM that manages the real DOM. It also
  creates a “synthetic” event system so that you can still react to events from
  the browser (such as clicks, scrolls, and other user-caused events).
</Figure>

##### Setting initial state

One key difference between updating or reassigning a value in JavaScript and
using `setState` is that React can choose to batch updates based on state
changes to maximize efficiency.

React implements a synthetic event system as a part of the virtual DOM that will
translate events in the browser into events for your React application. You can
set up event handlers that can respond to events from the browser, as you
normally would in JavaScript. One difference is that React event handlers are
set up on React elements or components themselves (as opposed to using
`addEventListener`).
