## Welcome to Linux

### What makes Linux different from other operating systems

A _distribution_ (sometimes shortened to _distro_) is a customized stack of
software thatâ€™s packaged along with the Linux kernel and distributed with tools
for installing a working version of Linux of user computers.

### Basic survival skills

#### The Linux file system

You can think of a file system as a data table (or an index) that creates
apparent connections between individual files and groups of files with
identifiable locations on a disk. A file system uses such an index to provide
the appearance of an organized set of directories and files within a single disk
division known as a _partition_.

**Note:** The most commonly used Linux file system is ext4.

All the files in a disk partition are kept in directories beneath the root
directory, which is represented by the `/` (forward slash) character. The way
these directories are arranged is largely governed by the UNIX Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
