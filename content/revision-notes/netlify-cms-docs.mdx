## Intro to Netlify CMS

### Overview

Netlify CMS is an open source content management system for your Git workflow
that enables you to provide editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows.
You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible
web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for
easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content
updates directly in Git.

At its core, Netlify CMS is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for
the Git workflow, using the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket API. This provides many
advantages, including:

- **Fast, web-based UI**: With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and
  drag-and-drop media uploads.
- **Platform agnostic**: Works with most static site generators.
- **Easy installation**: Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by
  including those files in your build process or linking to our Content Delivery
  Network (CDN).
- **Modern authentication**: Using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and JSON web
  tokens.
- **Flexible content types**: Specify an unlimited number of content types with
  custom fields.
- **Fully extensible:** Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor
  plugins.

If you hook up Netlify CMS to your website, you're basically adding a tool for
content editors to make commits to your site repository without touching code or
learning Git.
