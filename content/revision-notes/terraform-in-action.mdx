## Terraform bootcamp

### Getting started with Terraform

Terraform is a deployment technology for anyone who wants to provision and
manage their _infrastructure as code_ (IaC). _Infrastructure_ refers primarily
to cloud-based infrastructure, although anything that could be controlled
through an application programming interface (API) technically qualifies as
infrastructure. _Infrastructure as code_ is the process of managing and
provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files. We use
IaC to automate processes that used to be done manually.

When we talk about _provisioning_, we mean the act of deploying infrastructure,
as opposed to _configuration management_, which deals mostly with application
delivery, particularly on virtual machines (VMs). Configuration management (CM)
tools like Ansible, Puppet, SaltStack, and Chef are extremely popular and have
been around for many years. Terraform does not supplant these tools, at least
not entirely, because infrastructure provisioning and configuration management
are inherently different problems. That being said, Terraform does perform many
of the functions once reserved by CM tools, and many companies find they do not
need CM tools after adopting Terraform.

The basic principle of Terraform is that it allows you to write human-readable
configuration code to define your IaC. With configuration code, you can deploy
repeatable, ephemeral, consistent environments to vendors on the public,
private, and hybrid clouds.

#### What makes Terraform so great?

Six key characteristics make Terraform unique and give it a competitive
advantage:

- _Provisioning tool_—Deploys infrastructure, not just applications.
- _Easy to use_—For all of us non-geniuses.
- _Free and open source_—Who doesn’t like free?
- _Declarative_—Say what you want, not how to do it.
- _Cloud-agnostic_—Deploy to any cloud using the same tool.
- _Expressive and extendable_—You aren’t limited by the language.

##### Easy to use

The main reason Terraform is so easy to use is that the code is written in a
domainspecific configuration language called _HashiCorp Configuration Language_
(HCL).

HCL is fully compatible with JSON, which means HCL can be converted 1:1 to JSON
and vice versa. This makes it easy to interoperate with systems outside of
Terraform or generate configuration code on the fly.

##### Declarative programming

Declarative programming means you express the logic of a computation (the
_what_) without describing the control flow (the _how_). Instead of writing
step-by-step instructions, you describe what you want.

Declarative programming is in contrast to imperative (or procedural)
programming. Imperative programming languages use conditional branching, loops,
and expressions to control system flow, save state, and execute commands.

**Note:** Declarative programming cares about the destination, not the journey.
Imperative programming cares about the journey, not the destination.

Terraform integrates with different clouds through Terraform _providers_.
Providers are plugins for Terraform that are designed to interface with external
APIs. Providers are written in golang and distributed as binaries on the
Terraform Registry.
