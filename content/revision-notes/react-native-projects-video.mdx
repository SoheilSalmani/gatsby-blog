## Getting Prepared for React Native Projects

### Setting Up the Development Environment

Watch this [link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Examining the React Native Ecosystem

#### Starting a New Application

When starting a new application, the following tools can save you time and
implement current best practices:

- **React Native CLI:** allows developer to build projects with native code
- **expo-cli** allows developer to get started easily without having to
  configure any native tooling
- **Ignite CLI** has built in boilerplates and plugins to get developers off to
  a great start

#### React Native CLI: When and Why?

Great for those who:

- want to have access to native code
- do not ming the setup of iOS and Android environment

#### Expo: When and Why?

Great for those who:

- want to get a proof of concepts quickly
- beginners to mobile development
- want a simple setup and want to leverage expos tooling

#### Ignite: When and Why?

Great for those who:

- like patterns and trust code generator
- want to take advantage of plugins and boilerplates for getting started
- beginners transitioning from expo

#### Styling an Application

Utilizing a UI toolkit is beneficial for developers to produce consistent design
across platforms while saving time.

**NativeBase**:

- Theme generation for application
- Rich ecosystem
- Lots of starter kits
- Demo Expo app with all elements

**React Native Elements**:

- Highly customizable
- Less boilerplate
- More control over display
- Demo Expo app with all elements

#### Routing

**React Native Router Flux**:

- Lots of documentation
- Large API
- Customizable features

**React Navigation**:

- Complete JavaScript implementation
- Excellent documentation
- Simple implementation
- Customizable

### Overview of Project Approach

#### Agile Software Development

Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and
practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for
Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it.

#### Agile Key Terms

- **Scrum:** Process that allows teams to establish an idea of task difficulty,
  try it out, reflect on it, and make the adjustments accordingly
- **Extreme programming:** Specific process that focuses on engineering
  practices for software development
- **Feature-Driven Development (FDD):** Blended approach to deliver working
  features
- **Pair programming:** Drives collaboration by having two programmers share a
  workstation to work through tasks
- **Test-driven development:** Style that enforces testing, coding, and
  refactoring
- **Stand-ups:** Daily time boxed meeting to discuss development issues
- **Planning sessions:** Meeting to determine what's being worked on
- **Sprints:** Timeframe in which the development takes place

#### Core Values of the Agile Manifesto

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

#### 12 Principles of Agile

1. Satisfy the customer
2. Welcome changing requirements
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Collaborate daily
5. Motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation
7. Measure of progress through working project
8. Promote sustainable development
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regularly reflect on continuous improvements

#### User Stories?

Functional task that is a part of a larger project.

In consultation with the customer or product owner, the team divides up the work
to be done into functional increments called "user stories". Each user story is
expected to yield a constribution to the value of the overall product.

- As a mobile user, I want to be able to share my location, so I can let people
  know where I am
- As an admin user, I want to be able to restrict users from sharing their
  location, so I can enforce the paid benefits of the application

Each project will have:

- User stories that need to be completed
- Planning sessions for iterative development
- A clear goal

## Mastering CRUD Operations and Navigation with the Notes Application

### Setup and Review a Project Created with the react-native-cli

```sh
npx react-native init ReactNativeNotes
```

```sh
cd ReactNativeNotes
npx react-native run-ios
```

```js fp=index.js
/**
 * @format
 */

import { AppRegistry } from "react-native"
import App from "./App"
import { name as appName } from "./app.json"

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App)
```

1. Install NativeBase.
2. Install Async Storage.
3. Install React Navigation and the Stack Navigator.
4. Now, we need to wrap the whole app in `NavigationContainer`. Usually you'd do
   this in your entry file, such as `index.js` or `App.js`:

   ```jsx nu fp=App.js
   import "react-native-gesture-handler"
   import * as React from "react"
   import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native"

   export default function App() {
     return (
       <NavigationContainer>{/* Rest of your app code */}</NavigationContainer>
     )
   }
   ```

5. ```sh
   mkdir Components Contexts Screens
   ```

### Reviewing Note Application: Requirements and User Stories

What:

- is the goal of this application?
- are the project requirements?

The goal of the application is to store, create, and modify notes on a mobile
device.

Planning:

- Step 1: Each page has a common layout
- Step 2: We want access to our same data list throughout our application to
  modify it
- Step 3: We want to be able to navigate through multiple screens

Key Stories:

- As a user, I would like the style of the application to be consistent on each
  page
- As a user, I would like to access my notes in my application
- As a user, I would like to have an overview of my notes, with a detailed view
- As a user, I would like my notes get saved to my device

### Developing a Layout for Application with NativeBase

```jsx fp=Components/Layout.js
import React from "react"
import {
  Container,
  Header,
  Footer,
  FooterTab,
  Left,
  Right,
  Body,
} from "native-base"

export const Layout = props => (
  <Container>
    <Header>
      <Left>{props.left}</Left>
      <Body>
        <Title>{props.title}</Title>
      </Body>
      <Right>{props.right}</Right>
    </Header>
    {props.children}
    <Footer>
      <FooterTab>{props.footer}</FooterTab>
    </Footer>
  </Container>
)
```

```jsx fp=Components/Card.js
import React from "react"
import { Card, CardItem, Body, H3, Text } from "native-base"

export const NoteContent = ({ note }) => (
  <Card>
    <CardItem>
      <Body>
        <H3>{note.item.title}</H3>
        <Text>
          {note.item.content.length > 120
            ? `${note.item.content.substr(0, 120)}...}`
            : note.item.content}
        </Text>
      </Body>
    </CardItem>
  </Card>
)
```

### Reviewing Hooks

Why even create Hooks?

- We can write cleaner, more reusable code, with less complexity
- We can also use more React features, without classes

```jsx fp=Contexts/NoteContext.js
import React, { createContext, Component } from "react"
import { Alert } from "react-native"

export const NoteContext = createContext()

export class NoteProvider extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.getContextNotes = () => {
      return this.state.contextNotes
    }
    this.addContextNote = newNote => {
      const { contextNotes } = this.state
      contextNotes.push(newNote)
      this.setState({ contextNotes })
    }
    this.updateContextNote = (note, id) => {
      const { contextNotes } = this.state
      const noteIndex = contextNotes.findIndex(item => item.id === id)
      contextNotes[noteIndex].title = note.title
      contextNotes[noteIndex].content = note.content
      this.setState({ contextNote })
    }
    this.deleteContextNote = id => {
      const { contextNotes: oldNotes } = this.state
      const contextNotes = oldNotes.filter(note => note.id !== id)
      this.setState({ contextNotes })
    }
    this.state = {
      getContextNotes: this.getContextNotes,
      addContextNote: this.addContextNote,
      updateContextNote: this.updateContextNote,
      deleteContextNote: this.deleteContextNote,
      contextNotes: [],
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <NoteContext.Provider value={this.state}>
        {this.props.children}
      </NoteContext.Provider>
    )
  }
}
```

```jsx fp=Screens/HomeScreen.js
import React, { useEffect, useState, useContext } from "react"
import { Text, FlatList, TouchableOpacity } from "react-native"

import { Button } from "native-base"
import { Layout } from "../Components/Layout"
import { NoteContent } from "../Components/NoteContent"
import { NoteContext } from "../Contexts/NoteContext"

const HomeScreen = props => {
  const { getContextNotes } = useContext(NoteContext)
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState()

  useEffect(() => {
    const getData = () => {
      getContextNotes()
    }
    getData()
  }, [])

  return ()
}
```

### Advanced Navigation with React Navigation

- Utilized to move from screen to screen
- Managing the presentation of a transition
- Keeping record of navigation history

What is the Stack Navigator?

- The most common and simplest to understand navigation pattern React navigation
  has to offer
- New screen will be placed on top of the old screen
- Screens are represented as a stack
- Perfect fit for sequence-based apps where users need to be led

What is the Tab Navigator?

- A common navigation style within mobile applications
- Tabs are commonly at top or bottom of view:
  - `createBottomTabNavigator`
  - `createMaterialTopTabNavigator`
- Routes are lazily initialized
- Great for screens that are not related

What is the Drawer Navigator?

- A navigation style that pulls out from the side of the screen
- Drawer navigation is commonly used in Android applications:
  - Material implementation
- The UI apps are not on display here
- Used to maximize screen space

```jsx nu fp=App.js hl=4..8,10,14,16..23,25
import "react-native-gesture-handler"
import React from "react"
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native"
import { createStackNavigator } from "@react-navigation/stack"
import HomeScreen from "./Screens/HomeScreen"
import { AddNoteScreen } from "./Screens/AddNoteScreen"
import { ModifyNoteScreen } from "./Screens/ModifyNoteScreen"
import { NoteProvider } from "./Contexts/NoteProvider"

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NoteProvider>
      <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator
          initialRouteName="Home"
          headerMode="none"
        >
          <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
          <Stack.Screen name="AddNote" component={AddNoteScreen} />
          <Stack.Screen name="ModifyNote" component={ModifyNoteScreen} />
        <Stack.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
    <NoteProvider>
  )
}
```

```jsx fp=Screens/HomeScreen.js
import React, { useEffect, useState, useContext } from "react"
import { Text, FlatList, TouchableOpacity } from "react-native"

import { Button } from "native-base"
import { Layout } from "../Components/Layout"
import { NoteContent } from "../Components/NoteContent"
import { NoteContext } from "../Contexts/NoteContext"

const HomeScreen = props => {
  const { getContextNotes } = useContext(NoteContext)
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState()

  useEffect(() => {
    const getData = () => {
      getContextNotes()
    }
    getData()
  }, [])

  return (
    <Layout
      title="My Notes"
      footer={
        <Button full onPress={() => props.navigation.navigate("AddNoteScreen")}>
          <Text>Add Note</Text>
        </Button>
      }
    >
      <FlatList
        data={notes}
        keyExtractor={note => note.id}
        renderItem={note => (
          <TouchableOpacity
            onPress={() =>
              props.navigation.navigate("ModNote", {
                id: note.item.id,
              })
            }
          >
            <NoteContent note={{ ...note }} />
          </TouchableOpacity>
        )}
      />
    </Layout>
  )
}
```
