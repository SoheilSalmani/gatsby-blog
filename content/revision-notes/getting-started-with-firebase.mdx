## Add Firebase to an app

### Add Firebase to your iOS project

### Add Firebase to your Android project

### Add Firebase to your JavaScript project

#### Step 1: Create a Firebase project

Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to create a
Firebase project to connect to your app.

1. `Firebase console > Add project`: enter a project name. If you have an
   existing Google Cloud project, you can select the project from the dropdown
   menu to add Firebase resources to that project.
1. If you are creating a new project, you can edit the **Project ID**.
1. _(Optional)_ Set up Google Analytics for your project, which enables you to
   have an optimal experience using any of the following Firebase products:

   - Firebase Crashlytics
   - Firebase Predictions
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging
   - Firebase In-App Messaging
   - Firebase Remote Config
   - Firebase A/B Testing

   **Note:** You can always set up Google Analytics later in the _Integrations_
   tab of your settings _Project settings_.

#### Step 2: Register your app with Firebase

After you have a Firebase project, you can add your web app to it.

1. Click the **Web** icon to launch the setup workflow.
1. Enter you app's nickname. This nickname is an internal, convenience
   identifier and is only visible to you in the Firebase console.
1. _(Optional)_ Set up Firebase Hosting for your web app.

   - You can set up Firebase Hosting now or later. You can also link your
     Firebase Web App to a Hosting site at any time in your Project settings.
   - If you choose to set up Hosting up now, select a site from the dropdown
     list to link to your Firebase Web App.
     - This list displays your project's default Hosting site and any other
       sites that you've set up in your project.
     - Any site that you've already linked to a Firebase Web App is unavailable
       for additional linking. Each Hosting site can only be linked to a single
       Firebase Web App.

#### Step 3: add Firebase SDKs and initialize Firebase

How you add Firebase SDKs to your Web app depends on whether you've chosen to
use Firebase Hosting for your app, what tooling you're using with your app (like
a module bundler), or if you're configuring a Node.js app. Check this
[link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?hl=en&sdk_version=v9#with-npm).

To initialize Firebase in your app, you need to provide your app's Firebase
project configuration.

- If you use reserved Hosting URLs, your Firebase config is automatically pulled
  from your Firebase project, so you don't need to explicitly provide your
  config object in your code.
- If you enabled Google Analytics in your Firebase project, your config object
  contains the field `measurementId`.

**Note:** The Firebase config object contains unique, but non-secret identifiers
for your Firebase project.
