## Add Firebase to an app

### Add Firebase to your JavaScript project

#### Step 1: Create a Firebase project and register your app

1. <Scr>Add project</Scr>, then enter a project name.
2. If you are creating a new project, you can edit the **Project ID**.

After you have a Firebase project, you can add your web app to it.

1. <Scr>&lt;/&gt;</Scr>, then enter the app's nickname.
2. Click <Scr>Register app</Scr>.

#### Step 2: Install the SDK and initialize Firebase

This workflow uses npm and requires module bundlers or JavaScript framework
tooling because the v9 SDK is optimized to work with module bundlers to
eliminate unused code (tree-shaking) and decrease SDK size.

1. ```shell
   npm install firebase
   ```

2. Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:

   ```js
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"

   // TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
   const firebaseConfig = {
     // ...
   }

   const firebaseApp = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
   ```

A Firebase App is a container-like object that stores common configuration and
shares authentication across Firebase services. After you initialize a Firebase
App object in your code, you can add and start using Firebase services.

**Note:** The Firebase config object contains unique, but non-secret identifiers
for your Firebase project.

#### Step 3: Access Firebase in your app

Firebase services (like Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Realtime Database,
Remote Config, and more) are available to import within individual sub-packages.

The example below shows how you could use the Cloud Firestore Lite SDK to
retrieve a list of data.

```js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"
import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from "firebase/firestore/lite"
// Follow this pattern to import other Firebase services
// import { } from 'firebase/<service>';

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  //...
}

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
const db = getFirestore(app)

// Get a list of cities from your database
async function getCities(db) {
  const citiesCol = collection(db, "cities")
  const citySnapshot = await getDocs(citiesCol)
  const cityList = citySnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data())
  return cityList
}
```

#### Step 4: Use a module bundler (webpack/Rollup) for size reduction

The Firebase Web SDK is designed to work with module bundlers to remove any
unused code (tree-shaking). We strongly recommend using this approach for
production apps. Tools such as the Angular CLI, Next.js, Vue CLI, or Create
React App automatically handle module bundling for libraries installed through
npm and imported into your codebase.

## Add Firebase to a server

The Admin SDK is a set of server libraries that lets you interact with Firebase
from privileged environments to perform actions like:

- Read and write Realtime Database data with full admin privileges.
- Programmatically send Firebase Cloud Messaging messages using a simple,
  alternative approach to the Firebase Cloud Messaging server protocols.
- Generate and verify Firebase auth tokens.
- Access Google Cloud resources like Cloud Storage buckets and Cloud Firestore
  databases associated with your Firebase projects.
- Create your own simplified admin console to do things like look up user data
  or change a user's email address for authentication.

### Set up a Firebase project and service account

To use the Firebase Admin SDK, you'll need the following:

- A Firebase project
- A service account to communicate with Firebase
- A configuration file with your service account's credentials

### Add the SDK

```shell
npm install firebase-admin --save
```

```js
import * as admin from "firebase-admin"
```

## Set up project programmatically
