## Add Firebase to an app

### Add Firebase to your iOS project

_Not now..._

### Add Firebase to your Android project

_Not now..._

### Add Firebase to your JavaScript project

#### Step 1: Create a Firebase project

1. <Scr>Add project</Scr>, then enter a project name.
2. If you are creating a new project, you can edit the **Project ID**.

#### Step 2: Register your app with Firebase

After you have a Firebase project, you can add your web app to it.

1. <Scr>&lt;/&gt;</Scr>, then enter the app's nickname.
2. Optionally, you can set up Firebase Hosting for your web app.

#### Step 3: Add Firebase SDKs and initialize Firebase

How you add Firebase SDKs to your Web app depends on whether you've chosen to
use Firebase Hosting for your app, what tooling you're using with your app (like
a module bundler), or if you're configuring a Node.js app.

With npm:

1. ```shell
   npm init
   ```
2. ```shell
   npm install --save firebase@9.0.0-beta.7
   ```
3. To include only specific Firebase products (like Authentication and Cloud
   Firestore), import Firebase modules:

   ```js
   // Firebase App (the core Firebase SDK) is always required and must be listed first
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"

   // Add the Firebase products that you want to use
   import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth"
   import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore"
   ```

4. Initialize Firebase in your app:

   ```js
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"

   // TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
   const firebaseConfig = {
     // ...
   }

   const firebaseApp = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
   ```

To initialize Firebase in your app, you need to provide your app's Firebase
project configuration.

- If you use reserved Hosting URLs, your Firebase config is automatically pulled
  from your Firebase project, so you don't need to explicitly provide your
  config object in your code.
- If you enabled Google Analytics in your Firebase project, your config object
  contains the field `measurementId`.

**Note:** The Firebase config object contains unique, but non-secret identifiers
for your Firebase project.

#### Step 4: (Optional) Install CLI and deploy to Firebase Hosting

1. ```shell
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```
2. ```shell
   firebase login
   ```
3. ```shell
   firebase init
   ```

By default, every Firebase project has free subdomains on the `web.app` and
`firebaseapp.com` domains (`PROJECT_ID.web.app` and
`PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com`).

Run the following command from your app's root directory:

```shell
firebase deploy
```
