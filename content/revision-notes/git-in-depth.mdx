## Git Foundations

### Data Storage

#### How Does Git Store Information?

- At its core, git is like a key-value store.
- The **Value = Data**.
- The **Key = Hash of the Data**.
- You can use the key to retrieve the content.

#### The Key - SHA1

- Is a cryptographic hash function.
- Given a piece of data, it produces a 40-digit hexadecimal number.
- This value should always be the same if the given input is the same.

### Git Blobs and Trees

#### The Value - Blob

git stores the **compressed** data in a blob, along with metadata in a header:

- the identifier `blob`
- the size of the content
- `\0` delimiter
- content

<Figure src="/media/git-blob.png">A blob.</Figure>

#### Under the Hood - git hash-object

Asking Git for the SHA1 of contents:

```shell
echo 'Hello, World!' | git hash-object --stdin
```

Generating the SHA1 of the contents, with metadata:

```shell
printf 'blob 14\0Hello, World!\n' | openssl sha1
```

#### Where are blobs stored?

```shell
echo 'Hello, World!' | git hash-object -w --stdin
tree .git
```

```tree
.git
├── HEAD
├── branches
├── config
├── description
├── info
│   └── exclude
├── objects
│   ├── 8a
│   │   └── b686eafeb1f44702738c8b0f24f2567c36da6d
│   ├── info
│   └── pack
└── refs
    ├── heads
    └── tags
```

#### We need something else

The blob is missing information!

- filenames
- directory structures

Git stores this information in a **tree**.

#### Tree

A **tree** contains pointers (using SHA1):

- to blobs
- to other trees

and metadata:

- **_type_** of pointer (`blob` or `tree`)
- **_filename_** or directory name
- **_mode_** (executable file, symbolic link, ...)

<Figure src="/media/git-tree.png">A tree.</Figure>

#### Identical content is only stored one!

<Figure src="/media/git-identical-content.png">
  Identical content is only stored one!
</Figure>

#### Other Optimizations - Packfiles, Deltas

- Git objects are compressed.
- As files change, their contents remain mostly similar.
- Git optimizes for this by compressing theses files together, into a Packfile.
- The Packfile stores the object, and "deltas", or the differences between one
  version of the file and the next.
- Packfiles are generated when:
  - you have too many objects, during gc, or during a push to a remote

### Git Commits

#### Commit Object

A **commit** points to:

- a tree

and contains metadata:

- **_author_** and **_comitter_**
- **_date_**
- **_message_**
- **_parent commit_** (one or more)

The SHA1 of the commit is the hash of all this information.

<Figure src="/media/git-commit.png">A commit.</Figure>

#### Commits point to parent commits and trees

<Figure src="/media/git-commits-point-to.png">
  Commits point to parent commits and trees.
</Figure>

A COMMIT IS A CODE SNAPSHOT!

#### Commits Under the Hood - Make a Commit

When we make a commit, the first status line that we'll see tells us what the
hash of that commit is.

#### Commits Under the Hood - Look In `.git/objects`

```shell
tree .git/objects
```

#### Commits Under the Hood - Look at Objects

You can't inspect git objects using `cat` because these files are compressed.

#### git cat-file -t (type) and -p (print the contents)

```shell
git cat-file -t [sha1]
git cat-file -p [sha1]
```

#### Why Can't We "Change" Commits?

- If you change any data about the commit, the commit will have a new SHA1 hash.
- Even if the files don't change, the created date will.
- Good for security, you can't inject malicious code without changing the SHA1.
- Good for detecting file corruption.

#### References - Pointers to Commits

- Tags
- Branches
- HEAD - a pointer to the current commit

<Figure src="/media/git-references.png">References.</Figure>

Why is changing branches in Git lightning fast? Because just changing pointer.

#### References - Under the Hood

```tree
.git/
├── HEAD
└── refs
    ├── heads
    │   └── master
    └── tags
```

Branches stored in `.git/refs/heads`.

```shell
git log --oneline
cat .git/refs/heads/master
cat .git/HEAD
```

## Git Areas and Stashing

### Working Area, Staging Area, Repository

#### The Working Area

- The file in your working area that are _also not_ in the staging area are not
  handle by git.
- Also called **untracked files**.

#### The Staging Area (a.k.a Index, Cache)

- What files are going to be part of the next commit.
- The staging area is how git knows what will change between the current commit
  and the next commit.
- Tip: a "clean" staging area isn't empty!
- Consider the baseline staging area as being an exact copy of the latest
  commit.

The following plumbing command will show you what's in the staging area:

```shell
git ls-files -s
```

#### The Repository

- The files git knows about!
- Contains all of your commits.

#### Moving Files In & Out of the Staging Area

Add a file to the next commit:

```shell
git add <file>
```

Delete a file in the next commit:

```shell
git rm <file>
```

Rename a file in the next commit:

```shell
git mv <file>
```

#### git add -p

- One of my favorite tools.
- Allows you to stage commits in hunks.
- Interactively!
- It's especially useful if you've done too much work for one commit.

#### "Unstage" Files From the Staging Area

- Not removing the files.
- You're replacing them with a copy that's currently in the repository.

#### Basics: How Content Moves in Git

<Figure src="/media/how-content-moves-in-git.png">
  How content moves in Git.
</Figure>

### Stashing

#### git stash

- Save un-committed work.
- The stash is **safe** from destructive operations.

#### git stash - Basic Use

Stash changes:

```shell
git stash
```

List changes:

```shell
git stash list
```

Show the contents of the last stash:

```shell
git stash show
```

Show the contents of a specific stash:

```shell
git stash show stash@{0}
```

Apply the last stash:

```shell
git stash apply
```

Apply a specific stash:

```shell
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

#### Advanced Stashing - Keeping Files

Keep untracked files:

```shell
git stash --include-untracked
```

Keep all files (even ignored ones!):

```shell
git stash --all
```

#### Advanced Stashing - Operations

Name stashes for easy reference:

```shell
git stash save "WIP: making progress on foo"
```

Start a new branch from a stash (and remove the stash):

```shell
git stash branch <branch name>
```

Grab a single file from a stash:

```shell
git checkout <stash name> -- <filename>
```

#### Advanced Stashing - Cleaning the Stash

Remove the last stash and applying changes:

```shell
git stash pop
```

**Tip:** Doesn't remove if there's a merge conflict.

Remove the last stash:

```shell
git stash drop
```

Remove the nth stash:

```shell
git stash drop stash@{n}
```

Remove **_all_** stashes:

```shell
git stash clear
```

#### Advanced Stashing - Interactively

Interactively stash your changes in hunks:

```shell
git stash -p
```

## References, Commits, Branches

### References

#### Three types of git references

- Tags & Annotated Tags
- Branches
- HEAD

#### What's a Branch?

- A branch is just a pointer to a particular commit.
- The pointer of the current branch changes as new commits are made.

#### What is HEAD?

- **HEAD** is how git knows what branch you're currently on, and what the next
  parent will be.
- It's a pointer.
  - It usually points at the **_name_** of the current branch.
  - But, it can point at a commit too (detached HEAD).
- It moves when:
  - You make a commit in the currently active branch.
  - When you checkout a new branch.

```shell
cat .git/HEAD
```

### Tags & Annotated Tags

#### Lightweight Tags

- Lightweight tags are just a simple pointer to a commit.
- When you create a tag with no arguments, it captures the value in HEAD.

```shell
git tag my-first-commit
```

#### Annotated Tags: git tag -a

- Point to a commit, but store additional information (author, message, date).

```shell
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 of my blog"
git tag
git show v1.0
```

#### Working with Tags

List all the tags in a repo:

```shell
git tag
```

List all the tags, and what commit they're pointing to:

```shell
git show-ref --tags
```

List all the tags pointing at a commit:

```shell
git tag --points-at <commit>
```

Looking at the tag, or tagged contents:

```shell
git show <tag-name>
```

#### Tags & Branches

Branch:

- The current branch pointer moves with every commit to the repository

Tag:

- The commit that a tag points doesn't change.
- It's a snapshot!

### Detached Head & Dangling Commits

#### Head-less / Detached Head

- Sometimes you need to checkout a specific commit (or tag) instead of a branch.
- git moves the HEAD pointer to that commit
- As soon as you checkout a different branch or commit, the value of HEAD will
  point to the new SHA
- There is no reference pointing to the commits you made in a detached state.

Save your work:

- Create a new branch that points to the last commit you made in detached state.

  ```shell
  git branch <new-branch-name> <commit>
  ```

- Why the last commit? Because the other commits point to their parents.

#### Dangling Commits

Discard your work:

- If you don't point a new branch at those commits, they will no longer be
  referenced in git.
- Eventually, they will be garbaged collected.

## Merging and Rebasing

### Merging and Fast Forward

#### git merge --no-ff (No Fast Forward)

- To retain the history of a merge commit, even if there are no changes to the
  base branch:
  - use `git merge --no-ff`
- This will _force_ a merge commit, even when one isn't necessary.

```shell
git merge new_feature --no-ff
```

### Merge Conflicts

#### Merge Conflicts

- Attempt to merge, but files have diverged.
- Git stops until the conflicts are resolved.

#### git rerere - Reuse Recorded Resolution

- git saves how you resolved a conflict.
- Next conflict: reuse the same resolution.

Useful for:

- long lived feature branch (like a refactor),
- rebasing.

Turn it on:

```shell
git config rerere.enabled true
```

Use `--global` flag to enable for _all_ projects.

## History and Diffs

### Useful Commit Messages

#### Good Commits Are Important

- Good commits help preserve the history of a code base
- They help with:
  - debugging & troubleshooting
  - creating release notes
  - code reviews
  - rolling back
  - associating the code with an issue or ticket

#### Anatomy of a good commit

- Good commit message
- Encapsulates one logical idea
- Doesn't introduce breaking changes
  - i.e. tests pass

### Git Log

#### git log

The basic command that shows you the history of your repository.

#### git log --since

```shell
git log --since="yesterday"
git log --since="2 weeks ago"
```

#### git log --follow

Log files that have been moved or renamed:

```shell
git log --name-status --follow -- <file>
```

Example:

```shell
git log --grep=mail --author=nina --since=2.weeks
```

#### git log --diff-filter

Selectively include or exclude files that have been: (A)dded, (D)eleted,
(M)odified & more...

```shell
git log --diff-filter=R --stat
```

#### Git Log: Referencing Commits

- `^` or `^n`:
  - no args = `^1`: the first parent commit
  - `n`: the nth parent commit
- `~` or `~n`:
  - no args = `~1`: the first commit back, following 1st parent
  - `n`: number of commits back, _following only 1st parent_

**Note:** `^` and `~` can be combined.

### Git Show and Diffs

#### git show: Look at a Commit

Show commit and contents:

```shell
git show <commit>
```

Show files changed in commit:

```shell
git show <commit> --stat
```

Look at a file from another commit:

```shell
git show <commit>:<file>
```

#### Diff

Diff shows you changes:

- between commits
- between the staging area and the repository
- what's in the working area

Unstaged changes:

```shell
git diff
```

Staged changes:

```shell
git diff --staged
```

#### Diff Commits and Branches

<Figure src="/media/diff-commits-and-branches.png">
  Diff commits and branches.
</Figure>

#### "Diff" Branches

Which branches are merged with master, and can be cleaned up?

```shell
git branch --merged master
```

Which branches aren't merged with master yet?

```shell
git branch --no-merged master
```

### History and Diffs Exercise & Solution

## Fixing Mistakes

### Git Checkout

#### git checkout

Restore working tree files _or_ switch branches.

#### What happens when you git checkout a branch?

1. Change HEAD to point to the new branch.
2. Copy the commit snapshot to the staging area (index).
3. Update the working area with branch contents.

#### What happens when you git checkout -- file?

Replace the working area copy with the version from the current staging area.

**Warning:** This operation overwrites files in the working directory without
warning!

Overwrite the working area file with the staging area version from the last
commit:

```shell
git checkout -- <file_path>
```

#### What happens when you git checkout &lt;commit&gt; -- file?

1. Update the staging area to match the commit.
2. Update the working area to match the staging area.

#### git checkout: From a Specific Commit

Checkout a file from a specific commit:

- _copies to both working area & staging area_
- ```shell
  git checkout <commit> -- <file_path>
  ```

Restore a deleted file:

```shell
git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>
```

### Git Clean & Reset

#### git clean

- Git clean will clean your working area by **deleting** untracked files.
- Use the `--dry-run` flag to see what would be deleted.
- The `-f` flag to do the deletion.
- The `-d` flag will also clean directories.

#### git reset

Reset is another command that performs different actions depending on the
arguments.

- with a path
- without a path

By default, git performs a `git reset --mixed`.

For commits:

- Moves the HEAD pointer, optionally modifies files.

For file paths:

- Does not move the HEAD pointer, modifies files.

#### Reset --soft: Move HEAD

```shell
git reset --soft HEAD~
```

<Figure src="/media/git-reset-soft.png">Git reset (soft).</Figure>

#### Reset --mixed: Move HEAD, Copy Files to Stage

```shell
git reset --mixed HEAD~
git reset HEAD~
```

<Figure src="/media/git-reset-mixed.png">Git reset (mixed).</Figure>

#### Reset --hard: Move HEAD, Copy Files to Stage & Working

```shell
git reset --hard HEAD~
```

<Figure src="/media/git-reset-hard.png">Git reset (hard).</Figure>

#### git reset -- &lt;file&gt;

```shell
git reset -- <file>
```

<Figure src="/media/git-reset-file.png">Git reset (file argument).</Figure>

#### git reset &lt;commit&gt; -- &lt;file&gt;

```shell
git reset <commit> -- <file>
```

<Figure src="/media/git-reset-commit-file.png">
  Git reset (file argument).
</Figure>

**Note:** Only reset the staging area. This operation does not work with flags!

#### Undo a git reset with ORIG_HEAD

In case of an accidental `git reset`, Git keeps the previous value of HEAD in
variable called `ORIG_HEAD`.

To go back to the way things were:

```shell
git reset ORIG_HEAD
```

### Git Revert

Git revert creates a new commit that introduces the opposite changes from the
specified commit.

The original commit stays in the repository.

**Tip:** Use revert if you're undoing a commit that has already been shared.
Revert **_does not_** change history.

## Rebase and Amend

### Git Amend

#### Amend a Commit

Amend is a quick and easy shortcut that lets you make changes to the previous
commit.

```shell
git commit --amend
```

### Rebase

#### What Is Rebase Anyway?

- Imagine our `tech_posts` and `master` branch have diverged.
- We don't want a messy merge commit in our history.
- We can pull in all the latest changes from master, and apply our commits on
  top of them by changing the parent commit of our commits.

Rebase = give a commit a new parent (i.e. a new base commit)

#### Power of Rebasing - Replay Commits

Commits can be:

- edited
- removed
- combined
- re-ordred
- inserted

**Before** they're _"replayed"_ on top of the new HEAD.

#### Interactive Rebase (rebase -i or rebase --interactive)

Interactive rebase opens an editor with a list of "todos":

- in the format of: `<command> <commit> <commit msg>`
- git will pick the commits in the specified order, or stop to take an action
  when editing or a conflict occurs.

```shell
git rebase -i <commit_to_fix>^
```

#### Rebase Options

- `pick`: keep the commit.
- `reword`: keep the commit, just change the message.
- `edit`: keep the commit, but stop to edit more than the message.
- `squash`: combine the commit with the previous one, then stop to edit the
  message.
- `fixup`: combine the commit with the previous one, but keep the previous
  commit message.
- `exec`: run the command on this line after picking the previous commit.
- `drop`: remove the commit (**tip:** if you remove this line, the commit will
  be dropped too!).

#### Tip: Use Rebase to Split Commits

Editing a commit can also split it up into multiple commits!

1. Start an interactive rebase with `rebase -i`.
2. Mark the commit with an `edit`.
3. `git reset HEAD^`
4. `git add`
5. `git commit`
6. Repeat 4. and 5. until the working area is clean!
7. `git rebase --continue`

### Fixup and Autosquash

#### Tip: "Amend" Any Commit with Fixup & Autosquash!

What if we want to amend an arbitrary commit?

1. `git add` new files.
2. `git commit --fixup <commit>`: this creates a new commit, the message starts
   with "fixup!".
3. `git rebase -i --autosquash <commit>^`.
4. git will generate the right todos for you! Just save and quit.

Git will automatically reorder commits, and mark the commit with fixup action.

#### rebase --exec (Execute a Command)

```shell
git rebase -i --exec "run-tests" <commit>
```

2 options for exec:

1. Add it as a command when doing interactive rebase.
2. Use it as a flag when rebasing.

- When used as a flag, the command specified by exec will run after every commit
  is applied.
- This can be used to run tests.
- The rebase will stop if the command fails, giving you a change to fix what's
  wrong.

### Abort

#### Pull the Rip Cord!

At any time before rebase is done, if things are going wrong:

```shell
git rebase --abort
```

#### Rebase Pro Tip

Before your rebase/ fixup / squash / reorder:

1. Make a copy of your current branch: `git branch my_branch_backup`.
2. If rebase "succeeds" but you messed up...

   ```shell
   git reset my_branch_backup --hard
   ```

3. You're back in business!

#### Rebase Advantages

- Rebase is incredibly powerful!
- You can slice and dice your git history.
- It's easy to fix previous mistakes in code.
- You can keep your git history neat and clean.

**Important:** You should try to commit as much as possible while you're doing
your work.

#### Commit Early & Often vs Good Commits

Git Best Practice: "commit often, perfect later, publish once".

When working locally:

- commit whenever you make changes!
- it'll help you be a more productive developer.

Before pushing work to a shared repo:

- rebase to clean up the commit history.

#### Warning: Never Rewrite Public History!

- Rebase commits are copies.
- If other people are working on the same repository they would be working on
  different commits.
- You could cause massive merge conflicts.
- Even worse, you can cause people to lose their work!

## Forks & Remote Repos

### GitHub vs. Git

#### GitHub vs Git - The Key Is Collaboration

Git:

- Open source version control software

GitHub:

- Repository hosting
- Browse code
- Issues
- Pull Requests
- Forks

### Remotes

#### Remotes

- A remote is a git repository stored elsewhere - on the web, in GitHub, etc.
- **_origin_** is the default name git gives to the server you cloned from.
- Cloning a remote repository from a URL will fetch the whole repository, and
  make a local copy in your .git folder.
- You may have different privileges for a remote: Read/Write from some,
  Read-only for others.

#### Viewing Remotes

```shell
git remote -v
```

### Forks, Pull Requests, & Upstreams

#### Fork

- A fork is a copy of a repository that's stored in your GitHub account.
- You can clone your fork to your local computer.

#### Merging Changes to Original Project From a Fork

<Figure src="/media/merging-changes-to-original-project-from-a-fork.png">
  Merging changes to original project from a fork.
</Figure>

#### Staying Up to Date

- While you work on your fork, other changes are getting merged into the source
  repository.
- In order to stay up to date, set up an upstream.

#### Upstream

- The upstream repository is the base repository you created a fork from.
- This isn't set up by default, you need to set it up manually.
- By adding an upstream remote, you can pull down changes that have been added
  to the original repository after you forked it.

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIG_OWNER/REPO.git
```

### GitHub Workflow

#### Triangular Workflow

<Figure src="/media/triangular-workflow.png">The triangular workflow.</Figure>

#### Tracking branches

- Track a branch to tie it to an upstream branch. Bonus: Use git push / pull
  with no arguments.
- To checkout a remote branch, with tracking:

  ```shell
  git checkout -t origin/feature
  ```

- Tell Git which branch to track the first time you push:

  ```shell
  git push -u origin feature
  ```

#### Fetch

- Git fetch is important for keeping your local repository up to date with a
  remote.
- It pulls down all the changes that happened on the server.
- But, it doesn't change your local repository!

#### Pull

- Pulling will pull down the changes from the remote repository to your local
  repository, and merging them with a local branch.
- Under the hood: `git pull = git fetch && git merge`.
- If changes happened upstream, git will create a merge commit.
- Otherwise, it will fast-forward.

#### Push

- Pushing sends your changes to the remote repository.
- git only allows you to push if your changes won't cause a conflict.
- Tip: To see commits which haven't been pushed upstream yet, use:

  ```shell
  git cherry -v
  ```

#### git pull --rebase

- `git pull --rebase` will fetch, update your local branch to copy the upstream
  branch, then replay any commits you made via rebase.
- Bonus: When you open a PR, there will be no unsightly merge commits!

#### git pull vs git pull --rebase

<Figure src="/media/git-pull-vs-git-pull-rebase.png">

`git pull` vs `git pull --rebase`

</Figure>

#### Note: Tags

Git doesn't automatically push local tags to a remote repository.

To push tags:

- `git push <tagname>`
- `git push --tags`

#### Contributing to Open Source Projects - Pull Requests

Before opening a PR:

- Keep commit history clean and neat. Rebase if needed.
- Run projects tests on your code.
- Pull in upstream changes (preferably via rebase to avoid merge commits).
- Check for a `CONTRIBUTING.md/.txt` in the project root.

After opening a PR:

- Explain your changes throughly in the pull request.
- Link to any open issues that your pull request might fix.
- Check back for comments from the maintainers.

#### Advice

- Encourage developers to work on their own forks of a repository.
- Mistakes are less likely to happen if no one is pushing directly to the
  "source of truth" for you codebase.
- You can rebase and force push freely to _your own origin_, as long as no one
  else is cloning your branch.

#### Pushing/Merging Your Changes Back to a Remote

Rule of thumb:

- Rebase commits on your local feature branch.
- Merge feature branches back to origin (or upstream).

When accepting a pull request:

- Squash and merge or rebase with care.
- You'll lose context about the work on the feature branch!
- It'll make it harder to debug when issues arise in the future.

## Danger Zone

### Local and Remote Destructive Operations

#### Local Destructive Operations

`git checkout -- <file>`: If the file is present in the staging area, it'll be
overwritten.

`git reset --hard`: Will overwrite changes that are staged and in the working
area.

Unless changes are stashed, there's **_no way_** of getting them back!

**Tip:** use `git stash --include-untracked` to include working area changes in
your stash.

#### Remote Destructive Operations - Rewriting History

There are many operations that can rewrite history:

- rebase
- amend
- reset

If your code is hosted or shared, **never run `git push -f`**.

### Recover Lost Work

#### Recover Lost Work

Use `ORIG_HEAD`, the commit `HEAD` was pointing to before a:

- reset
- merge

Checkout for repository copies:

- GitHub
- Coworker

#### ORIG_HEAD to Undo a Merge

```shell
git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD
```

Use `--merge` flag to preserve any uncomitted changes.

#### Using Git Reflog And '@' Syntax

- By default, git keeps commits around for about 2 weeks.
- If you need to go back in time, and find a commit that's no longer referenced,
  you can look in the reflog.

The syntax of reflog is differents:

- `HEAD@{2}` means "the value of HEAD 2 moves ago"

## GitHub

### GitHub Shortcuts

#### Naviage Like a Pro

- Press <Kbd>?</Kbd> on any page to get a list of shortcuts.

Repositories:

- <Kbd>g</Kbd> <Kbd>c</Kbd>: Go to Code
- <Kbd>g</Kbd> <Kbd>i</Kbd>: Go to Issues
- <Kbd>g</Kbd> <Kbd>p</Kbd>: Go to Pull Requests
- <Kbd>g</Kbd> <Kbd>b</Kbd>: Go to Projects
- <Kbd>g</Kbd> <Kbd>w</Kbd>: Go to Wiki

Source code browsing:

- <Kbd>t</Kbd>: Activates the file finder
- <Kbd>l</Kbd>: Jump to line
- <Kbd>w</Kbd>: Switch branch/tag
- <Kbd>y</Kbd>: Expand URL to its canonical form
- <Kbd>i</Kbd>: Show/hide all inline notes

### Continuous Integration

- Merging smaller commits frequently, instead of waiting until a project is
  "done" and doing one big merge.
- This means that features can be released quicker!
- CI only works well when there are tests that ensure that new commits didn't
  "break the build".
- It's even possible to perform deployment at the end of a CI build!

### Travis CI

- Travis CI is free for open source projects!
- It's easy to specify what commands you need to run tests.
- It's also easy to test against multiple versions of a language (Python 2 vs
  Python 3) and even mutliple versions of libraries.
- Tests run automatically on branches and pull requests.

Getting set up is easy:

1. Go to [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/), log in with your GitHub
   account.
2. Add a `travis.yml` configuration file.
3. Push to trigger builds.

## Advanced GitHub

### GitHub API

#### GitHub API

- GitHub has incredibly powerful RESTful API.
- [Libraries](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/libraries)!
