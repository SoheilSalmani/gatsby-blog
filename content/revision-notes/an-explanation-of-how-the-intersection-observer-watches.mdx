## A brief explanation of the Intersection Observer

"This specification describes an API that can be used to understand the
visibility and position of DOM elements (“targets”) relative to a containing
element or to the top-level viewport (“root”). The position is delivered
asynchronously and is useful for understanding the visibility of elements and
implementing pre-loading and deferred loading of DOM content."

## A basic example

The Observer is made up of 4 parts:

1. the “root”, which is the parent element the observer is tied to, which can be
   the viewport
2. the “target,” which is a child element being observed and there can be more
   than one
3. the options object, which defines certain aspects of the observer’s behavior
4. the callback function, which is invoked each time an intersection change is
   observed

```js nu
const options = {
  root: document.body,
  rootMargin: "0px",
  threshold: 0,
}

function callback(entries, observer) {
  console.log(observer)

  entries.forEach(entry => {
    console.log(entry)
  })
}

let observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options)
observer.observe(targetElement)
```

The `root` is the parent element, often a scrolling element, that contains the
observed elements. This can be just about any single element on the page as
needed. If the property isn’t provided at all or the value is set to null, the
viewport is set to be the root element.

The `rootMargin` is a string of values describing what can be called the margin
of the root element, which affects the resulting bounding box that the target
element scrolls into. It behaves much like the CSS margin property. You can have
values like `10px 15px 20px` which gives us a top margin of `10px`, left and
right margins of `15px`, and a bottom margin of `20px`. Only the bounding box is
affected and not the element itself. Keep in mind that the only lengths allowed
are pixels and percentage values, which can be negative or positive. Also note
that the rootMargin does not work if the root element is not an actual element
on the page, such as the viewport.

The `threshold` is the value used to determine when an intersection change
should be observed. More than one value can be included in an array so that the
same target can trigger the intersection multiple times. These values relate to
the target’s intersection ratio. A threshold of zero triggers the intersection
when the first pixel of the target element intersects the root element. A
threshold of one triggers when the entire target element is inside the root
element.

In the callback function, 2 parameters are passed; the entries are stored in an
array and represent each target element that triggers the intersection change.
This provides a good bit of information that can be used for the bulk of any
functionality that a developer might create. The second parameter is information
about the observer itself, which is essentially the data from the provided
`options` object. This provides a way to identify which observer is in play in
case a target is tied to multiple observers.

The third section in the code is the creation of the observer itself and where
it is observing the target. When creating the observer, the callback function
and options object can be external to the observer, as shown. A developer could
write the code inline, but the observer is very flexible. For example, the
callback and options can be used across multiple observers, if needed. The
`observe()` method is then passed the target element that needs to be observed.
It can only accept one target but the method can be repeated on the same
observer for multiple targets. Again, very flexible.

### The observer object

Contains essentially the `options` object passed into the observer when it was
created.

### The entry object

For most devs, the two properties that are most likely to be useful are
`intersectionRatio` and `isIntersecting`. The `isIntersecting` property is a
boolean that is exactly what one might think it is — the target element is
intersecting the root element at the time of the intersection change. The
`intersectionRatio` is the percentage of the target element that is currently
intersecting the root element. This is represented by a percentage of zero to
one, much like the threshold provided in the observer’s option object.

Three properties — `boundingClientRect`, `intersectionRect`, and `rootBounds` —
represent specific data about three aspects of the intersection. The
`boundingClientRect` property provides the bounding box of the target element
with bottom, left, right, and top values from the top-left of the viewport, just
like with `Element.getBoundingClientRect()`. Then the height and width of the
target element is provided as the X and Y coordinates. The `rootBounds` property
provides the same form of data for the root element. The `intersectionRect`
provides similar data but its describing the box formed by the intersection area
of the target element inside the root element, which corresponds to the
`intersectionRatio` value.

The `target` property refers to the target element that is being observed. In
cases where an observer contains multiple targets, this is the easy way to
determine which target element triggered this intersection change.

The `time` property provides the time (in milliseconds) from when the observer
is first created to the time this intersection change is triggered. This is how
you can track the time it takes for a viewer to come across a particular target.
Even if the target is scrolled into view again at a later time, this property
will have the new time provided. This can be used to track the time of a target
entering and leaving the root element.

While all this information is provided to us whenever an intersection change is
observed, it’s also provided to us when the observer is first started. For
example, on page load the observers on the page will immediately invoke the
callback function and provide the current state of every target element it is
observing.
