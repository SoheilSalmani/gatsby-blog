## Create a Cloud Firestore database

Select a starting mode for your Cloud Firestore Security Rules:

- **Test mode:** Good for getting started with the mobile and web client
  libraries, but allows anyone to read and overwrite your data.
- **Locked mode:** Denies all reads and writes from mobile and web clients. Your
  authenticated application servers (C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, or
  Ruby) can still access your database.

**Warning:** After you set your project's default GCP resource location, you
cannot change it.

**Note:** You can't use both Cloud Firestore and Cloud Datastore in the same
project, which might affect apps using App Engine. Try using Cloud Firestore
with a different project.

## Set up your development environment

```shell
npm install firebase@9.0.0-beta.7 --save
```

```js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore"
```

## (Optional) Prototype and test with Firebase Local Emulator Suite

If you're trying out different data models, optimizing your security rules, or
working to find the most cost-effective way to interact with the back-end, being
able to work locally without deploying live services can be a great idea.

A Cloud Firestore emulator is part of the Local Emulator Suite, which enables
your app to interact with your emulated database content and config, as well as
optionally your emulated project resources (functions, other databases, and
security rules).

## Initialize Cloud Firestore

```js
// Initialize Cloud Firestore through Firebase
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore"
const firebaseApp = initializeApp({
  apiKey: "### FIREBASE API KEY ###",
  authDomain: "### FIREBASE AUTH DOMAIN ###",
  projectId: "### CLOUD FIRESTORE PROJECT ID ###",
})

const db = getFirestore()
```

## Add data

Cloud Firestore stores data in Documents, which are stored in Collections. Cloud
Firestore creates collections and documents implicitly the first time you add
data to the document. You do not need to explicitly create collections or
documents.

```js
import { collection, addDoc } from "firebase/firestore"

try {
  const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "users"), {
    first: "Ada",
    last: "Lovelace",
    born: 1815,
  })
  console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id)
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Error adding document: ", e)
}
```

Now add another document to the `users` collection. Notice that this document
includes a Documents in a collection can contain different sets of information.

```js
// Add a second document with a generated ID.
import { addDoc, collection } from "firebase/firestore"

try {
  const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "users"), {
    first: "Alan",
    middle: "Mathison",
    last: "Turing",
    born: 1912,
  })
  console.log("Document written with ID: ", docRef.id)
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Error adding document: ", e)
}
```

## Read data

```js
import { collection, getDocs } from "firebase/firestore"

const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, "users"))
querySnapshot.forEach(doc => {
  console.log(`${doc.id} => ${doc.data()}`)
})
```

## Secure your data

Use Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore Security Rules to secure your
data in Cloud Firestore.

If you're using one of the server SDKs, use Identity and Access Management (IAM)
to secure your data in Cloud Firestore.
