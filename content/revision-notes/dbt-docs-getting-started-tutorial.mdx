## Getting Started

### Setting up

```sql nu
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),


final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
```

### Create a BigQuery project

Create a new project in GCP, and run the query using BigQuery.

### Generate BigQuery credentials

Create a service account named `dbt-user`. Give the `BigQuery User` role. Name
the keyfile `dbt-user-creds.json`.

### Choose the way you want to develop

There’s two main ways of working with dbt:

- Edit files and run projects using the web-based Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE) in **dbt Cloud**.
- Edit files locally using a code editor, and run projects using the Command
  Line Interface (**dbt CLI**).

## Create a project

### dbt Cloud

1. <Scr>Account settings | New Project | Begin</Scr>
2. Name your project `dbt Tutorial`.
3. <Scr>BigQuery</Scr>
4. Name your database connection `BigQuery`.
5. <Scr>Upload a Service Account JSON file</Scr>
6. Test your connection.
7. <Scr>Continue | Managed</Scr>
8. Name your repository `soheil-dbt-tutorial`.
9. <Scr>>_ Start Developing | initialize your project</Scr>

```yaml fp=dbt_project.yml hl=1,6
name: jaffle_shop # This normally says my_new_package

# ...

models:
  jaffle_shop: # This normally says my_new_package. It should match the value for `name:`
  # ...
```

In the terminal bar at the bottom of the screen, type in `dbt run` and hit
enter. Then, commit your changes.

### dbt CLI

```shell
pip install dbt
dbt --version
dbt init jaffle-shop
cd jaffle_shop
```

When developing locally, dbt connects to your data warehouse using a profile — a
YAML file with all the connection details to your warehouse.

```yaml nu fp=~/.dbt/profiles.yml
jaffle_shop: # This needs to match the profile: in your dbt_project.yml file
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account
      keyfile: <key-file-full-path>.json
      project: <project-id>
      dataset: dbt_<your-name>
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US
      priority: interactive
```

```yaml hl=1,5,10 fp=dbt_project.yml
name: jaffle_shop # This normally says my_new_package

# ...

profile: jaffle_shop # This normally says default

# ...

models:
  jaffle_shop: # This normally says my_new_package. It should match the value for `name:`
  # ...
```

```shell
dbt debug
```

**What should I name my profile?** We typically use a company name for a profile
name, and then use targets to differentiate between dev and prod.

**What should I name my target?** We typically use targets to differentiate
between development and production runs of dbt, naming the targets `dev` and
`prod` respectively.

**Can I use environment variables in my profile?** Yes!

Build the models:

```shell
dbt run
```
