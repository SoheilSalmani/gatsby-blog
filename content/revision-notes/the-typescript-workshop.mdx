## TypeScript Fundamentals

### Introduction

#### Design Goals of TypeScript

The design goals of TypeScript, as initially stated, were as follows:

- Extend JavaScript to facilitate writing large applications.
- Create a strict superset of JavaScript (that is, any valid JavaScript is valid
  TypeScript).
- Enhance the development tooling support.
- Generate JavaScript that runs on any JavaScript execution environment.
- Easy transfer between TypeScript and JavaScript code.
- Generate clean, idiomatic JavaScript.
- Align with future JavaScript standards.

### Getting Started with TypeScript

```ts nu fp=add.ts
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y
}
```

```shell
tsc add.ts
```

This will generate our output file, `add.js`. The code is identical, and we have
our first successful transpilation.

#### The TypeScript Compiler

Get a full list of the options:

```shell
tsc --all
```

The most common and important ones are as follows:

- `-outFile`: The name of the output file we want to be generated. It defaults
  to the same name as the input file, but with the `.js` extension.
- `–outDir`: The location of the output file(s). By default, the generated files
  will be in the same location as the source files.
- `-types`: To specify additional types that will be allowed in our source code.
- `-lib`: To specify which library files need to be loaded. As there are
  different execution environments for JavaScript, with different default
  libraries (for example, browser JavaScript has a `window` object, and Node.js
  has a `process` object), we can specify which one we want to target. We can
  also use this option to allow or disallow specific JavaScript functionality.
- `-target:` specify which version of the ECMAScript (that is, JavaScript)
  language we're targeting.

#### Setting Up a TypeScript Project

We can save our default options in a special file that will be accessed by the
tsc command. The best way to generate this special file called `tsconfig.json`
is to use `tsc` itself with the `--init` option.

```shell
tsc --init
```

Exercise 1.01:

```ts nu fp=squares.ts
function squares(array: number[]) {
  const result = array.map(x => x * x)
  return result
}
```

```shell
tsc squares.ts
```

```shell
tsc --target es6 squares.ts
```

#### Types and Their Uses

```ts
let variable: number
```

The `: number` part of the code is called a type annotation. This type of
annotation is explicit and specific to TypeScript. Another way is simply to
assign a value to a variable and let TypeScript work its magic. The magic is
called _type inference_, and that means that TypeScript will try to guess the
type of the variable based on the value provided. Actually, in most cases, we
won't even need to add type annotations, as TypeScript's powerful type inference
engine will correctly infer the type of the variable.

### TypeScript and Functions

JavaScript does not enforce that the number of actual arguments has to conform
to the number of parameters defined. In JavaScript, we can call a function with
more arguments than parameters, fewer arguments, or even without any arguments
at all. If we have more arguments than needed, the extra arguments are simply
ignored (and stored in the magical `arguments` variable), and if we have fewer
arguments than needed, the extra parameters are given the value `undefined`.

In TypeScript, a function can only be called using valid arguments – both in
number and in type.

```ts
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y
}
```

Exercise 1.02:

```ts nu fp=snippet.ts
function snippet(text: string, length: number): string {
  if (text.length < length) {
    return text
  }
  const ellipsis = "..."
  let result = text.slice(0, length - ellipsis.length)
  const lastSpace = result.lastIndexOf(" ")
  result = `${result.slice(0, lastSpace)}${ellipsis}`

  return result
}

const resultOne = snippet(
  "TypeScript is a programming language that is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.",
  40
)
```

```shell
tsc snippet.ts
node snippet.js
```
