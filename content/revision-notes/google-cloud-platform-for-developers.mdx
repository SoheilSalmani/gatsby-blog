## Why GCP?

The infrastructure Google offers in GCP is the same infrastructure Google uses
internally.

Google looks to stand out as a leader in scalable managed services and big data.

## The Google Cloud Console

### Creating a project

When creating a projet, Google will will automatically convert this name to a
**globally unique identifier**, which you will often use when interacting with
Google Cloud APIs.

Once finished, you'll need to enable billing to get started building solutions
on GCP. Project billing is managed through billing accounts, which associates a
user or organization with payment information. A billing account can be used for
multiple projects and project billing can be managed by any project billing
administrator.

Enable billing: <Scr>Billing | Link a billing account</Scr> or <Scr>Billing |
Manage billing accounts</Scr>.

### The Google Cloud Console

The Google Cloud Platform offers a range of channels for managing and
interacting with project resources and services, including the Google Cloud
Console, command-line tools, mobile applications, IDE plugins, web APIs, and
libraries for many popular programming languages.

#### Understanding the Cloud Console dashboard

Use the <Scr>Customize</Scr> button to customize the _Dashboard_ section in the
Google Cloud Console.

A real-time stream of activity within your project is available in the
_Activity_ view. This offers users a quick way to see what high-level operations
are taking place such as administrative tasks, error alerts, information about
quotas, and changes to project settings.

If you find that you are using certain components within the Cloud Console
regularly, it may be useful to pin your favorite products and services to the
top of the menu.

- Open/Collapse navigation menu: <Kbd>.</Kbd>.
- Begin a search: <Kbd>/</Kbd>.
- If you're working between multiple application life cycles or teams, you'll
  likely need to switch between projects often: <Kbd>âŒ˜ + O</Kbd>.

### The Google Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell runs on top of a `g1-small` Google Compute Engine instance. This VM
is provisioned on a per-session basis, and the underlying resources are
regularly recycled. To facilitate a productive developer environment, the Cloud
Shell preserves the user's `$HOME` directory by backing it with a 5 GB
persistent disk.

#### Supporting multiple sessions

You can create a new session with the Add Cloud Shell Session (<Scr>+</Scr>)
button to the right of these tabs. You may notice that opening the shell from a
new browser windows will cause active sessions in other windows to disconnect,
displaying a notification that the session was transferred; this is due to the
default **tmux** integrations.

- Enable/Disable Tmux integration: <Scr>Terminal settings | Tmux Settings |
  Enable Tmux</Scr>.

#### Features and integrations

Improve keyboard functionality when using the Cloud Shell: <Scr>Send key
combination | Install Chrome extension</Scr>.

#### File management

The Cloud Shell supports transferring files between the VM and your local
machine: <Scr>More settings | Upload/Download</Scr>.

Downloads can also be done from within the shell by using the included
`cloudshell` command:

```shell
cloudshell download <FILENAME ...>
```

#### Web Preview

The Cloud Shell Web Preview is a quick and easy way to test web services without
leaving your browser. Web Preview creates a publicly available proxy on your
specified port, allowing you to access any web service running on that port. The
proxy is secured over HTTPS and includes an authentication layer to ensure that
only you can access your exposed service. Web Preview runs on port `8080` by
default.

The Web Preview can be very helpful for testing code while away from your
workstation. For example, one could clone source code from a GCP Source
Repository and test changes locally. Alternatively, developers can debug
applications stored as Docker images in the Google Container Registry, or test
applications using the Cloud Shell's included App Engine development server.

#### The Cloud Shell Code Editor

The Code Editor allows you to easily view and edit files within your Cloud
Shell's `$HOME` directory.

#### Opening in Cloud Shell

To quickly get up and running with scripts and tutorials in the Cloud Shell,
Google offers integrations for publicly hosted git repositories on GitHub and
BitBucket. With the click of a button, users can clone git repositories into
their Cloud Shell `$HOME` directory and open them in a new Cloud Shell Code
Editor session.

#### Trying it out

1. Visit this
   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Google-Cloud-Platform-for-Developers).
2. Click <Scr>Open in Cloud Shell</Scr>.
3. ```shell
   cd chapter_02/example_01
   ```
4. ```shell
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
5. <Scr>Web Preview</Scr>
6. Use the Code Editor to modify `static/index.html`.

#### Installing additional tools

For many of the included programming languages, the Cloud Shell comes
preconfigured with tools to support multiple versions. The current Java version
can be changed via the `update-java-alternatives` command available from the
`java-commons` package. For Node.js, this can be done using the Node Version
Manager command `nvm`. Python comes with both `python` for version 2 and 3. In
addition, the Cloud Shell VM includes `virtualenv` for managing Python
dependency versioning on a per-service basis.

There are a couple of ways around this, such as creating an install script to
reinstall needed binaries. Another option is to install binaries directly in
`$HOME/bin`, which will be automatically added to your system path. A third and
often easier way to bring in additional tools is to leverage the included
`docker` tools to pull and run Docker images as needed. Files and folders inside
the `$HOME` directory can then be mounted as volumes to persist container data
across sessions:

```groovy nu fp=example.groovy
println "Groovy script running successfully..."
```

```shell
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/app groovy groovy /app/example.groovy
```

#### Repairing the Cloud Shell

- <Scr>More | Safe Mode</Scr>.

## APIs, CLIs, IAM, and Billing

### Google Cloud APIs

#### Managing APIs

The Google Cloud Console offers a reasonably detailed dashboard for controlling
API access and monitoring usage. To view the dashboard, go to <Scr>Navigation
menu | APIs & Services | Dashboard</Scr>. Clicking on any service API here will
allow you to dive into more detail about that specific service, including a
per-account and per-endpoint view of usage.

By default, some APIs are disabled for your Google Cloud project. A disabled API
will not be accessible and will therefore not incur any charges. In these cases,
you will often see a notification that the API is disabled along with an option
to enable it. To enable APIs, it is often useful to use the Google Cloud API
Library, available at <Scr>Navigation menu | APIs & Services | Library</Scr>.

#### Google APIs Explorer

The APIs Explorer offers developers a straightforward interface where you can:

- Search for APIs by products and services
- Browse the methods available for an API
- Authenticate against an API and grant specific authorization scopes
- Execute requests for a given API method and view the response

When you've found an API method you would like to execute, the APIs Explorer
will present a form with the various fields of the request body, along with a
description of each field.

For authorizing the request, the APIs Explorer will present a list of required
OAuth2 scopes and allow you to modify these scopes. This can be useful when
developing against APIs to see how different permissions affect the request.

#### Trying out the APIs Explorer

1. Search "Compute Engine"
2. Select "Compute Engine API v1"
3. Find the `compute.instance.list` method
4. Set <Scr>project</Scr> to your Google Cloud project ID
5. Set <Scr>zone</Scr> to any zone.
6. Click on <Scr>Execute</Scr>.

### The Google Cloud SDK

For normal day-to-day operations and basic task automation, Google offers a set
of command-line tools as part of the Google Cloud SDK. In addition to
command-line tools, the Google Cloud SDK also includes tools to aid in local
application development, including a local App Engine development server and
emulators for cloud services, such as Pub/Sub, Datastore, and Bigtable.

#### Installing the Google Cloud SDK

The Google Cloud SDK installs the following tools by default:

- `gcloud`: A command-line interface for managing cloud resources.
- `bq`: Commands for interacting with Google BigQuery.
- `gsutil`: Tools for Google Cloud Storage.

The SDK image is available on Docker Hub as `google/cloud-sdk`.

### The gcloud command-line tool

#### The basic of gcloud

The gcloud interface is composed of three basic types: _groups_, _commands_, and
_global flags_.

#### Command groups

A group is a set of commands that are tied to a specific aspect of Google Cloud.
Most of these relate to Google Cloud products and services.

In addition to product-specific groups, some groups are specific to managing the
Google Cloud SDK itself. These groups include `auth`, `components`, `config`,
and `topic`. In addition, gcloud contains two special command groups: `alpha`
and `beta`. These groups are not enabled by default and provide a secondary set
of command groups for commands that are not yet considered generally available.

In general, you'll specify a command group, a type of resource, an action, and
any identifiers and flags. Actions usually include standard CRUD operations, as
well as any product-specific operations.

Commands that relate to GCP products and services are very similar in structure
to their underlying APIs.

#### Root commands

Outside of groups, gcloud contains a few additional commands that do not belong
to a specific group. These commands are available at the root level of CLI and
include `docker`, `feedback`, `help`, `info`, `init`, and `version`. The
`gcloud docker` command allows users to interact directly with the Google
Container Registry. The other commands offer operations on CLI itself. Using
`gcloud info` will display a detailed view of your current configuration and
environment, including the active account and the project you are operating
against. This is a very useful command to quickly check that you are running
commands in the desired context.

**Tip:** Find a bug? Try `gcloud feedback`.

For all commands in the gcloud CLI, users can specify a number of global flags
to modify command behavior. The `--account`, `--project`, and `--configuration`
flags allow you to override the current defaults for your environment. These are
useful to avoid modifying or switching configurations to run a few quick
commands. Other global flags including `--quiet`, `--flatten`, `--format`, and
`--verbosity` allow users to modify the output from running commandsâ€”often
useful when running scripts or debugging operations.

**Tip:** A great way to see how gcloud performs various actions is to use the
`--log-http` global flag.

In addition, users can learn about CLI-wide concepts using the gcloud topic
command group. For example, to learn about using the `--filter` flag available
in all list-producing operations, you can run `gcloud topic filter`.

#### Initializing the Google Cloud SDK

```shell
gcloud init
```

#### Authentication

Google uses OAuth 2.0 for API access. When a user authorizes the SDK, Google
will store an access token for that user locally for later use.

Login:

```shell
gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser
```

The Google Cloud SDK has an established process for storing authentication
tokens on a system. For local development, the default location is in
`$HOME/.config/gcloud`.

Alternatively, users can assume the identity of a service account to take
actions on that service account's behalf:

```shell
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=</path/to/key/file>
```

Show available account on your machine:

```shell
gcloud auth list
```

Google Cloud SDKs and libraries are able to load credentials from known default
locations, generally referred to as _application default credentials_.

During local development, it is often preferable to have Google SDKs and
libraries load a specific application default credentials. To do this, users can
set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to a
valid credentials file. This will usually be a service account's JSON key file,
but you may instead use your own user credentials by running
`gcloud auth application-default login`. This default credentials can then be
removed by running `gcloud auth application-default revoke`.

**Note:** Although Google Cloud client libraries will function with a user's
credentials, it is considered best practice to assume the identity of a service
account for most activities, including local development.

#### Managing your Google Cloud SDK

List the SDK components:

```shell
gcloud components list
```

By default, the Cloud SDK ships with a very few components installed. The
default components include `gcloud`, `bq`, and `gsutil`, which are often all you
will need for basic interactions with Google Cloud.

Components can be installed or removed on an individual basis at any time with:

```shell
gcloud components <install|remove> <COMPONENT_ID>
```

#### Updating and rollbacks

Component updates can be applied by running `gcloud components update`. This
will list any components that have available updates along with any release
notes. Updates are run transactionally, and old versions of components
(including the SDK core libraries) are preserved locally as backups.

Transactional updates enable users to quickly switch between versions of the
SDK, which can be done by providing an optional `--version` flag such as
`gcloud components update --version 1.8.1`.

Google Cloud SDK component releases are tied to specific versions of the SDK,
making it possible to associate a specific version of the SDK components with a
versioned build of your own services. For operations, this can be a great way to
help ensure repeatable build processes.

If at any time, you find that a component stops functioning correctly (for
instance, if you've modified the SDK files), you can usually repair any damage
by reinstalling the components. This can be done by running
`gcloud components reinstall`. Note that any changes you've made to the SDK will
be lost.

#### Alpha and beta channels

To use alpha and beta features within gcloud:

```shell
gcloud components install <alpha|beta>
```

To use alpha and beta commands:

```shell
gcloud alpha <command ...>
gcloud beta <command ...>
```

#### Configurations in the Google Cloud SDK

Configuration properties can be viewed, modified, and deleted using the
`gcloud config` command group.

#### Modifying configuration properties

To see the current values of all configuration properties:

```shell
gcloud config list --all
```

Read a configuration property:

```shell
gcloud config get-value <property>
```

Change a configuration property:

```shell
gcloud config set <property> <value>
```

Remove a configuration property:

```shell
gcloud config unset <property>
```

When modifying a property with `set`, you'll need to specify a property as part
of a group in the format `group/property`.

If no group is specified, gcloud will attempt to set the property in the `core`
group.

Configuration properties can often be overridden by passing a flag to a command.
For example, while setting `core/project` is ideal for long-term use, users can
also pass the `--project` global flag to any command to target a different
project. This behavior is useful for quick on-off commands as well as cases
where the default value should not be trusted (such as when running a script).

#### Multiple configurations

The Google Cloud SDK includes support for separate _configurations_. A
configuration is an isolated set of configuration properties, and the Google
Cloud SDK tools are able to switch between configurations as the user wills. We
provisioned our first configuration, _default_, when running `gcloud init`.

You can create any number of additional configurations either by rerunning
`gcloud init` or by running `gcloud config configurations create <name>`. For
managing and switching between configurations, use the
`gcloud config configurations` command group. To switch between configurations:

```shell
gcloud config configurations activate <configuration>
```

To modify a value across all configurations, gcloud supports an optional
`--installation` flag.

gcloud also accepts the global `--configuration` flag. Aside from user defined
configurations, the Google Cloud SDK contains a special `NONE` configuration.
This configuration has no set properties, making it ideal for easily ensuring no
configuration properties will affect command behavior.
