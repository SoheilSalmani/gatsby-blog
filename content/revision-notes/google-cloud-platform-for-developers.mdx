## Why GCP?

The infrastructure Google offers in GCP is the same infrastructure Google uses
internally.

Google looks to stand out as a leader in scalable managed services and big data.

## The Google Cloud Console

### Creating a project

When creating a projet, Google will will automatically convert this name to a
**globally unique identifier**, which you will often use when interacting with
Google Cloud APIs.

Once finished, you'll need to enable billing to get started building solutions
on GCP. Project billing is managed through billing accounts, which associates a
user or organization with payment information. A billing account can be used for
multiple projects and project billing can be managed by any project billing
administrator.

Enable billing: <Scr>Billing | Link a billing account</Scr> or <Scr>Billing |
Manage billing accounts</Scr>.

### The Google Cloud Console

The Google Cloud Platform offers a range of channels for managing and
interacting with project resources and services, including the Google Cloud
Console, command-line tools, mobile applications, IDE plugins, web APIs, and
libraries for many popular programming languages.

#### Understanding the Cloud Console dashboard

Use the <Scr>Customize</Scr> button to customize the _Dashboard_ section in the
Google Cloud Console.

A real-time stream of activity within your project is available in the
_Activity_ view. This offers users a quick way to see what high-level operations
are taking place such as administrative tasks, error alerts, information about
quotas, and changes to project settings.

If you find that you are using certain components within the Cloud Console
regularly, it may be useful to pin your favorite products and services to the
top of the menu.

- Open/Collapse navigation menu: <Kbd>.</Kbd>.
- Begin a search: <Kbd>/</Kbd>.
- If you're working between multiple application life cycles or teams, you'll
  likely need to switch between projects often: <Kbd>âŒ˜ + O</Kbd>.

### The Google Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell runs on top of a `g1-small` Google Compute Engine instance. This VM
is provisioned on a per-session basis, and the underlying resources are
regularly recycled. To facilitate a productive developer environment, the Cloud
Shell preserves the user's `$HOME` directory by backing it with a 5 GB
persistent disk.

#### Supporting multiple sessions

You can create a new session with the Add Cloud Shell Session (<Scr>+</Scr>)
button to the right of these tabs. You may notice that opening the shell from a
new browser windows will cause active sessions in other windows to disconnect,
displaying a notification that the session was transferred; this is due to the
default **tmux** integrations.

- Enable/Disable Tmux integration: <Scr>Terminal settings | Tmux Settings |
  Enable Tmux</Scr>.

#### Features and integrations

Improve keyboard functionality when using the Cloud Shell: <Scr>Send key
combination | Install Chrome extension</Scr>.

#### File management

The Cloud Shell supports transferring files between the VM and your local
machine: <Scr>More settings | Upload/Download</Scr>.

Downloads can also be done from within the shell by using the included
`cloudshell` command:

```shell
cloudshell download <FILENAME ...>
```

#### Web Preview

The Cloud Shell Web Preview is a quick and easy way to test web services without
leaving your browser. Web Preview creates a publicly available proxy on your
specified port, allowing you to access any web service running on that port. The
proxy is secured over HTTPS and includes an authentication layer to ensure that
only you can access your exposed service. Web Preview runs on port `8080` by
default.

The Web Preview can be very helpful for testing code while away from your
workstation. For example, one could clone source code from a GCP Source
Repository and test changes locally. Alternatively, developers can debug
applications stored as Docker images in the Google Container Registry, or test
applications using the Cloud Shell's included App Engine development server.

#### The Cloud Shell Code Editor

The Code Editor allows you to easily view and edit files within your Cloud
Shell's `$HOME` directory.

#### Opening in Cloud Shell

To quickly get up and running with scripts and tutorials in the Cloud Shell,
Google offers integrations for publicly hosted git repositories on GitHub and
BitBucket. With the click of a button, users can clone git repositories into
their Cloud Shell `$HOME` directory and open them in a new Cloud Shell Code
Editor session.

#### Trying it out

1. Visit this
   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Google-Cloud-Platform-for-Developers).
2. Click <Scr>Open in Cloud Shell</Scr>.
3. ```shell
   cd chapter_02/example_01
   ```
4. ```shell
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
5. <Scr>Web Preview</Scr>
6. Use the Code Editor to modify `static/index.html`.

#### Installing additional tools

For many of the included programming languages, the Cloud Shell comes
preconfigured with tools to support multiple versions. The current Java version
can be changed via the `update-java-alternatives` command available from the
`java-commons` package. For Node.js, this can be done using the Node Version
Manager command `nvm`. Python comes with both `python` for version 2 and 3. In
addition, the Cloud Shell VM includes `virtualenv` for managing Python
dependency versioning on a per-service basis.

There are a couple of ways around this, such as creating an install script to
reinstall needed binaries. Another option is to install binaries directly in
`$HOME/bin`, which will be automatically added to your system path. A third and
often easier way to bring in additional tools is to leverage the included
`docker` tools to pull and run Docker images as needed. Files and folders inside
the `$HOME` directory can then be mounted as volumes to persist container data
across sessions:

```groovy nu fp=example.groovy
println "Groovy script running successfully..."
```

```shell
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/app groovy groovy /app/example.groovy
```
