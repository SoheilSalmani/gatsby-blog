## Welcome to Docker

### What is Docker?

#### "Hello, World"

```shell
docker run dockerinaction/hello_world
```

<Figure src="/media/what-happens-after-docker-run.png">

What happens after running `docker run`.

</Figure>

The second part specifies the program that you want Docker to run in a
container. In this example, that program is `dockerinaction/hello_world`. This
is called the _image_ (or _repository_) _name_.

Understand that the running state of a container is directly tied to the state
of a single running program inside the container. If a program is running, the
container is running. If the program is stopped, the container is stopped.
Restarting a container will run the program again.

When you use `docker run` the second time, it creates a second container from
the same repository. This means that if you repeatedly use `docker run` and
create a bunch of containers, you’ll need to get a list of the containers you’ve
created and maybe at some point destroy them.

#### Running software in containers for isolation

Docker uses Linux namespaces and cgroups, which have been part of Linux
since 2007. Docker doesn’t provide the container technology, but it specifically
makes it simpler to use.

  line.

Notice that the command-line interface, or CLI, runs in what is called _user
space memory_, just like other programs that run on top of the operating system.

</Figure>

It shows three running containers. Each is running as a child process of the
Docker engine, wrapped with a container, and the delegate process is running in
its own memory subspace of the user space. Programs running inside a container
can access only their own memory and resources as scoped by the container.

Docker builds containers using 10 major system features:

- _PID namespace_—Process identifiers and capabilities
- _UTS namespace_—Host and domain name
- _MNT namespace_—Filesystem access and structure
- _IPC namespace_—Process communication over shared memory
- _NET namespace_—Network access and structure
- _USR namespace_—User names and identifiers
- _`chroot` syscall_—Controls the location of the filesystem root
- _cgroups_—Resource protection
- _CAP drop_—Operating system feature restrictions
- _Security modules_—Mandatory access controls

Docker uses those to build containers at runtime, but it uses another set of
technologies to package and ship containers.

#### Shipping containers

Docker completes the traditional container metaphor by including a way to
package and distribute software. The component that fills the shipping container
role is called an _image_.

Docker image is a bundled snapshot of all the files that should be available to
a program running inside a container. You can create as many containers from an
image as you want. But when you do, containers that were started from the same
image don’t share changes to their filesystem. When you distribute software with
Docker, you distribute these images, and the receiving computers create
containers from them. Images are the shippable units in the Docker ecosystem.

Docker provides a set of infrastructure components that simplify distributing
Docker images. These components are registries and indexes. You can use publicly
available infrastructure provided by Docker Inc., other hosting companies, or
your own _registries_ and _indexes_.

### What problems does Docker solve?

- Getting organized
- Improving portability
- Protecting your computer

### Running software in containers

#### Controlling containers: Building a website monitor

<Figure src="/media/nginx-mailer-watcher.png">
  The three containers that you’ll build in this example.
</Figure>

##### Creating and starting a new container

The NGINX image is what Docker Inc. calls a _trusted repository_. Generally, the
person or foundation that publishes the software controls the trusted
repositories for that software.

```shell
docker run --detach --name web nginx:latest
```

After Docker has installed and started running NGINX, one line of seemingly
random characters will be written to the terminal. That blob of characters is
the unique identifier of the container that was just created to run NGINX.

The program started but isn’t attached to your terminal. Running detached
containers is a perfect fit for programs that sit quietly in the background.
That type of program is called a _daemon_, or a _service_. A daemon generally
interacts with other programs or humans over a network or some other
communication channel.

Another daemon that your client needs in this example is a mailer. A _mailer_
waits for connections from a caller and then sends an email.

```shell
docker run -d
    \ --name mailer
    dockerinaction/ch2_mailer
```

##### Running interactive containers

A terminal-based text editor is a great example of a program that requires an
attached terminal. It takes input from the user via a keyboard (and maybe mouse)
and displays output on the terminal. It is interactive over its input and output
streams. Running interactive programs in Docker requires that you bind parts of
your terminal to the input or output of a running container.

```docker
docker run --interactive --tty \
    --link web:web \
    --name web_test \
    busybox:1.29 /bin/sh
```

The command uses two flags on the run command: `--interactive` (or `-i`) and
`--tty` (or `-t`). First, the `--interactive` option tells Docker to keep the
standard input stream (stdin) open for the container even if no terminal is
attached. Second, the `--tty` option tells Docker to allocate a virtual terminal
for the container, which will allow you to pass signals to the container. This
is usually what you want from an interactive command-line program. You’ll
usually use both of these when you’re running an interactive program such as a
shell in an interactive container.

The command in the interactive container example creates a container, starts a
UNIX shell, and is linked to the container that’s running NGINX.

```shell
wget -O - http://web:80/
```

This uses a program called `wget` to make an HTTP request to the web server (the
NGINX server you started earlier in a container) and then display the contents
of the web page on your terminal.

It’s possible to create an interactive container, manually start a process
inside that container, and then detach your terminal. You can do so by holding
down the <Kbd>Ctrl + P</Kbd> and then <Kbd>Q</Kbd>. This will work only when
you’ve used the `--tty` option.

To finish the work for your client, you need to start an agent. This is a
monitoring agent that will test the web server and send a message with the
mailer if the web server stops.

```shell
docker run -it \
    --name agent \
    --link web:insideweb \
    --link mailer:insidemailer \
    dockerinaction/ch2_agent
```

##### Listing, stopping, restarting, and viewing output of containers

Check which containers are currently running:

```shell
docker ps
```

Running the command will display the following information about each running
container:

- The container ID
- The image used
- The command executed in the container
- The time since the container was created
- The duration that the container has been running
- The network ports exposed by the container
- The name of the container

Restart each container:

```shell
docker restart web
docker restart mailer
docker restart agent
```

Examine the logs for each container:

```shell
docker logs web
docker logs mailer
docker logs agent
```

The `docker logs` command can be helpful for these cases but is dangerous to
rely on. Anything that the program writes to the stdout or stderr output streams
will be recorded in this log. The problem with this pattern is that the log is
never rotated or truncated by default, so the data written to the log for a
container will remain and grow as long as the container exists. That long-term
persistence can be a problem for long-lived processes. A better way to work with
log data uses volumes.

**Tip:** The `docker logs` command has a flag, `--follow` or `-f`, that will
display the logs and then continue watching and updating the display with
changes to the log as they occur. When you’ve finished, press <Kbd>Ctrl +
C</Kbd> to interrupt the `logs` command.

The `docker stop` command tells the program with PID 1 in the container to halt.

```shell
docker stop web
docker logs mailer
```

#### Solved problems and the PID namespace

Every running program—or process—on a Linux machine has a unique number called a
_process identifier (PID)_. A PID _namespace_ is a set of unique numbers that
identify processes. Linux provides tools to create multiple PID namespaces. Each
namespace has a complete set of possible PIDs. This means that each PID
namespace will contain its own PID 1, 2, 3, and so on.

Most programs will not need access to other running processes or be able to list
the other running processes on the system. And so Docker creates a new PID
namespace for each container by default. A container’s PID namespace isolates
processes in that container from processes in other containers.

Without a PID namespace, the processes running inside a container would share
the same ID space as those in other containers or on the host. A process in a
container would be able to determine what other processes were running on the
host machine.

List all processes running on the computer:

```shell
docker run --pid host busybox:1.29 ps
```

Environment independence provides the freedom to configure software taking
dependencies on scarce system resources without regard for other co-located
software with conflicting requirements. Here are some common conflict problems:

- Two programs want to bind to the same network port.
- Two programs use the same temporary filename, and file locks are preventing
  that.
- Two programs want to use different versions of a globally installed library.
- Two processes want to use the same PID file.
- A second program you installed modified an environment variable that another
  program uses. Now the first program breaks.
- Multiple processes are competing for memory or CPU time.

All these conflicts arise when one or more programs have a common dependency but
can’t agree to share or have different needs. Docker solves software conflicts
with such tools as Linux namespaces, resource limits, filesystem roots, and
virtualized network components. All these tools are used to isolate software
inside a Docker container.

#### Eliminating metaconflicts: Building a website farm

Docker helps you avoid software conflicts with process isolation. But if you’re
not careful, you can end up building systems that create _metaconflicts_, or
conflicts between containers in the Docker layer.

##### Flexible container identification

Rename a container:

```shell
docker rename webid webid-old
```

The first way to get the numeric ID of a container is to simply start or create
a new one and assign the result of the command to a shell variable. When a new
container is started in detached mode, the container ID will be written to the
terminal (stdout). You’d be unable to use this with interactive containers if
this were the only way to get the container ID at creation time. Luckily, you
can use another command to create a container without starting it. The
`docker create` command is similar to `docker run`, the primary difference being
that the container is created in a stopped state.

```shell
CID=$(docker create nginx:latest)
echo $CID
```

Both the `docker run` and `docker create` commands provide another flag to write
the ID of a new container to a known file:

```shell
docker create --cidfile /tmp/web.cid nginx
cat /tmp/web.cid
```

Docker won’t create a new container by using the provided CID file if that file
already exists.

**Tip:** One strategy for dealing with CID file-naming collisions is to
partition the namespace by using known or predictable path conventions. For
example, in this scenario, you might use a path that contains all web containers
under a known directory and further partition that directory by the customer ID.
This would result in a path such as `/containers/web/customer1/web.cid` or
`/containers/web/customer8/web.cid`.

In other cases, you can use other commands such as `docker ps` to get the ID of
a container. To get the truncated ID of the last created container:

```shell
CID=$(docker ps --latest --quiet)
echo $CID

CID=%(docker ps -l -q)
echo $CID
```

**Tip:** To get the full container ID, you can use the `--no-trunc` option.

##### Container state and dependencies

```shell
MAILER_CID=$(docker run -d dockerinaction/ch2_mailer)
WEB_CID=$(docker create nginx)
AGENT_CID=$(docker create --link $WEB_CID:insideweb \
  --link $MAILER_CID:insidemailer \
  dockerinaction/ch2_agent)
```

To see all the containers (including those in the created state), use the `-a`
option:

```shell
docker ps -a
```

```shell
docker start $WEB_CID
docker start $AGENT_CID
```

**The legacy of container network linking:** Network links were an early and
popular way to connect containers. Links create a _unidirectional_ network
connection from one container to other containers on the same host. Significant
portions of the container ecosystem asked for fully peered, _bidirectional_
connections between containers. Docker provides this with the userdefined
networks. These networks can also extend across a cluster of hosts. Network
links and user-defined networks are not equivalent, but Docker recommends
migrating to user-defined networks.

```shell
MAILER_CID=$(docker run -d dockerinaction/ch2_mailer)
WEB_CID=$(docker run -d nginx)
AGENT_CID=$(docker run -d \
    --link $WEB_CID:insideweb \
    --link $MAILER_CID:insidemailer \
    dockerinaction/ch2_agent)
```

If you build systems or software that know too much about their environment—for
example, addresses or fixed locations of dependency services—it’s difficult to
change that environment or reuse the software. You need to deliver a system that
minimizes environment dependence before the contract is complete.
