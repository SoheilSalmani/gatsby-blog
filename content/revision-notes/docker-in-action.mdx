## Welcome to Docker

### What is Docker?

#### "Hello, World"

```shell
docker run dockerinaction/hello_world
```

The second part specifies the program that you want Docker to run in a
container. In this example, that program is `dockerinaction/hello_world`. This
is called the _image_ (or _repository_) _name_.

Understand that the running state of a container is directly tied to the state
of a single running program inside the container. If a program is running, the
container is running. If the program is stopped, the container is stopped.
Restarting a container will run the program again.

When you use `docker run` the second time, it creates a second container from
the same repository. This means that if you repeatedly use `docker run` and
create a bunch of containers, you’ll need to get a list of the containers you’ve
created and maybe at some point destroy them.

#### Running software in containers for isolation

Docker uses Linux namespaces and cgroups, which have been part of Linux
since 2007. Docker doesn’t provide the container technology, but it specifically
makes it simpler to use.

Notice that the command-line interface, or CLI, runs in what is called _user
space memory_, just like other programs that run on top of the operating system.

It shows three running containers. Each is running as a child process of the
Docker engine, wrapped with a container, and the delegate process is running in
its own memory subspace of the user space. Programs running inside a container
can access only their own memory and resources as scoped by the container.

Docker builds containers using 10 major system features:

- _PID namespace_—Process identifiers and capabilities
- _UTS namespace_—Host and domain name
- _MNT namespace_—Filesystem access and structure
- _IPC namespace_—Process communication over shared memory
- _NET namespace_—Network access and structure
- _USR namespace_—User names and identifiers
- _`chroot` syscall_—Controls the location of the filesystem root
- _cgroups_—Resource protection
- _CAP drop_—Operating system feature restrictions
- _Security modules_—Mandatory access controls

Docker uses those to build containers at runtime, but it uses another set of
technologies to package and ship containers.

#### Shipping containers

Docker completes the traditional container metaphor by including a way to
package and distribute software. The component that fills the shipping container
role is called an _image_.

Docker image is a bundled snapshot of all the files that should be available to
a program running inside a container. You can create as many containers from an
image as you want. But when you do, containers that were started from the same
image don’t share changes to their filesystem. When you distribute software with
Docker, you distribute these images, and the receiving computers create
containers from them. Images are the shippable units in the Docker ecosystem.

Docker provides a set of infrastructure components that simplify distributing
Docker images. These components are registries and indexes. You can use publicly
available infrastructure provided by Docker Inc., other hosting companies, or
your own _registries_ and _indexes_.
