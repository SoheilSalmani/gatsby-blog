## HTML — Structuring the Web

### Introduction to HTML

#### Getting started with HTML

##### What is HTML?

Tags in HTML are case-insensitive.

##### Anatomy of an HTML element

The anatomy of an HTML element is composed of:

- the opening tag,
- the content,
- the closing tag.

The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing
tag.

###### Block versus inline elements

There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level
elements and inline elements.

- Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element
  appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Block-level
  elements are usually structural elements on the page. A block-level element
  wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside
  another block-level element.
- Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only
  small parts of the document’s content. An inline element will not cause a new
  line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an
  &lt;a&gt; element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as &lt;em&gt; or
  &lt;strong&gt; create emphasis.

**Note:** The terms block and inline, as used in this article, should not be
confused with the types of CSS boxes that have the same names. While the names
correlate by default, changing the CSS display type doesn't change the category
of the element, and doesn't affect which elements it can contain and which
elements it can be contained in. One reason HTML5 dropped these terms was to
prevent this rather common confusion.

###### Empty elements

Empty elements are sometimes called _void elements_.

##### Attributes

###### Boolean attributes

```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```

```html
<!-- Shorthand -->
<input type="text" disabled />
```

###### Single or double quotes?

```html
<a href='https://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'>A link to my example.</a>
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- Fixed -->
<a href="https://www.example.com" title='Isn&apos;t this fun?'>A link to my example.</a>
```

##### Anatomy of an HTML document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

##### Entity references: Including special characters in HTML

In HTML, the characters `<`, `>`,`"`,`'` and `&` are special characters.

- `<` &rArr; `&lt;`
- `>` &rArr; `&gt;`
- `"` &rArr; `&quot;`
- `'` &rArr; `&apos;`
- `&` &rArr; `&amp;`

### JavaScript first steps

#### What is JavaScript?

##### What is JavaScript doing on your page?

Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets
are called "execution environments" in technical terms).

##### How do you add JavaScript to your page?

###### Internal JavaScript

```html nu fp=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Internal JavaScript example</title>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        function createParagraph() {
          let para = document.createElement("p")
          para.textContent = "You clicked the button!"
          document.body.appendChild(para)
        }

        const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")

        for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
          buttons[i].addEventListener("click", createParagraph)
        }
      })
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button>Click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### External JavaScript

```html nu fp=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>External JavaScript example</title>
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button>Click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js nu fp=script.js
function createParagraph() {
  let para = document.createElement("p")
  para.textContent = "You clicked the button!"
  document.body.appendChild(para)
}

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")

for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
  buttons[i].addEventListener("click", createParagraph)
}
```

###### Inline JavaScript handlers

**Warning:** Following is a bad practice.

```html
<button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!</button>
```

###### Script loading strategies

The `defer` attribute, which tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML
content once the `<script>` tag element has been reached.

**Note:** In the external case, we did not need to use the `DOMContentLoaded`
event because the `defer` attribute solved the problem for us. We didn't use the
`defer` solution for the internal JavaScript example because `defer` only works
for external scripts.

An old-fashioned solution to this problem used to be to put your script element
right at the bottom of the body (e.g. just before the `</body>` tag), so that it
would load after all the HTML has been parsed. The problem with this solution is
that loading/parsing of the script is completely blocked until the HTML DOM has
been loaded. On larger sites with lots of JavaScript, this can cause a major
performance issue, slowing down your site.

###### async and defer

`async` and `defer` both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a
separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so
the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.

If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies,
then use `async`.

If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the
DOM being in place, load them using `defer` and put their corresponding
`<script>` elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
