### Getting started with the Web

## HTML — Structuring the Web

### Introduction to HTML

#### Getting started with HTML

##### What is HTML?

Tags in HTML are case-insensitive.

##### Anatomy of an HTML element

The anatomy of an HTML element is composed of:

- the opening tag,
- the content,
- the closing tag.

The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing
tag.

###### Block versus inline elements

There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level
elements and inline elements.

- Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element
  appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Block-level
  elements are usually structural elements on the page. A block-level element
  wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside
  another block-level element.
- Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only
  small parts of the document’s content. An inline element will not cause a new
  line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an
  &lt;a&gt; element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as &lt;em&gt; or
  &lt;strong&gt; create emphasis.

**Note:** HTML5 redefined the element categories. While these definitions are
more accurate and less ambiguous than their predecessors, the new definitions
are a lot more complicated to understand than _block_ and _inline_.

**Note:** The terms _block_ and _inline_, as used in this article, should not be
confused with the types of CSS boxes that have the same names. While the names
correlate by default, changing the CSS display type doesn't change the category
of the element, and doesn't affect which elements it can contain and which
elements it can be contained in. One reason HTML5 dropped these terms was to
prevent this rather common confusion.

###### Empty elements

Empty elements are sometimes called _void elements_.

##### Attributes

Elements can also have attributes. Attributes contain extra information about
the element that won't appear in the content.

###### Boolean attributes

```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```

```html
<!-- Shorthand -->
<input type="text" disabled />
```

###### Single or double quotes?

```html
<a href='https://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'>A link to my example.</a>
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- Fixed -->
<a href="https://www.example.com" title='Isn&apos;t this fun?'>A link to my example.</a>
```

##### Anatomy of an HTML document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of
rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More
recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for
everything else to work right. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the shortest string of
characters that counts as a valid doctype.

###### Whitespace in HTML

No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can
include one or more space character, but also line breaks), the HTML parser
reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code.

##### Entity references: Including special characters in HTML

In HTML, the characters `<`, `>`,`"`,`'` and `&` are special characters.

- `<` &rArr; `&lt;`
- `>` &rArr; `&gt;`
- `"` &rArr; `&quot;`
- `'` &rArr; `&apos;`
- `&` &rArr; `&amp;`

#### What’s in the head? Metadata in HTML

##### What is the HTML head?

The head's job is to contain metadata about the document.

##### Adding a title

The `<title>` element is used to add a title to the document.

- The `<h1>` element appears on the page when loaded in the browser — generally
  this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content
  (the story title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage.)
- The `<title>` element is metadata that represents the title of the overall
  HTML document (not the document's content.)

`<title>` is also used as pre-filled bookmark name and in search results.

##### Metadata: the `<meta>` element

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding
metadata to a document — the `<meta>` element. There are a lot of different
types of `<meta>` elements that can be included in your page's `<head>`.

###### Specifying your document's character encoding

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```

Many `<meta>` elements include `name` and `content` attributes.

###### Adding an author and description

```html
<meta name="author" content="Chris Mills" />
<meta
  name="description"
  content="The MDN Web Docs Learning Area aims to provide complete beginners to the Web with all they need to know to get started with developing web sites and applications."
/>
```

Specifying an author is beneficial in many ways: it is useful to be able to
understand who wrote the page, if you have any questions about the content and
you would like to contact them. Some content management systems have facilities
to automatically extract page author information and make it available for such
purposes.

Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your
page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in
relevant searches performed in search engines (such activities are termed Search
Engine Optimization, or SEO.)

The description is also used on search engine result pages.

**Note:** In Google, you will see some relevant subpages listed below the main
homepage link — these are called sitelinks, and are configurable in Google's
webmaster tools — a way to make your site's search results better in the Google
search engine.

###### Other types of metadata

As you travel around the web, you'll find other types of metadata, too. A lot of
the features you'll see on websites are proprietary creations, designed to
provide certain sites (such as social networking sites) with specific pieces of
information they can use.

For example, Open Graph Data is a metadata protocol that Facebook invented to
provide richer metadata for websites.

```html
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/opengraph-logo.png"
/>
<meta
  property="og:description"
  content="The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and HTML5 Apps. It also documents Mozilla products, like Firefox OS."
/>
<meta property="og:title" content="Mozilla Developer Network" />
```

Twitter also has its own similar proprietary metadata called Twitter Cards,
which has a similar effect when the site's URL is displayed on `twitter.com`.
For example:

```html
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Mozilla Developer Network" />
```

## JavaScript — Dynamic client-side scripting

### JavaScript first steps

#### What is JavaScript?

##### What is JavaScript doing on your page?

Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets
are called "execution environments" in technical terms).

##### How do you add JavaScript to your page?

###### Internal JavaScript

```html nu fp=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Internal JavaScript example</title>
    <script>
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        function createParagraph() {
          let para = document.createElement("p")
          para.textContent = "You clicked the button!"
          document.body.appendChild(para)
        }

        const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")

        for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
          buttons[i].addEventListener("click", createParagraph)
        }
      })
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button>Click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### External JavaScript

```html nu fp=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>External JavaScript example</title>
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button>Click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js nu fp=script.js
function createParagraph() {
  let para = document.createElement("p")
  para.textContent = "You clicked the button!"
  document.body.appendChild(para)
}

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")

for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
  buttons[i].addEventListener("click", createParagraph)
}
```

###### Inline JavaScript handlers

**Warning:** Following is a bad practice.

```html
<button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!</button>
```

###### Script loading strategies

The `defer` attribute, which tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML
content once the `<script>` tag element has been reached.

**Note:** In the external case, we did not need to use the `DOMContentLoaded`
event because the `defer` attribute solved the problem for us. We didn't use the
`defer` solution for the internal JavaScript example because `defer` only works
for external scripts.

An old-fashioned solution to this problem used to be to put your script element
right at the bottom of the body (e.g. just before the `</body>` tag), so that it
would load after all the HTML has been parsed. The problem with this solution is
that loading/parsing of the script is completely blocked until the HTML DOM has
been loaded. On larger sites with lots of JavaScript, this can cause a major
performance issue, slowing down your site.

###### async and defer

`async` and `defer` both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a
separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so
the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.

If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies,
then use `async`.

If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the
DOM being in place, load them using `defer` and put their corresponding
`<script>` elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.

##### Comments

Comments in JavaScript: `//` or `/* */`.
