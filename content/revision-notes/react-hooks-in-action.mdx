## React is evolving

### What is React?

#### Understanding component types

The React team recommends the use of functions for components in new projects
(although there is no plan to remove class components, so no need for big
rewrites of existing projects).

- **Stateless function component:** A JavaScript function that is passed
  properties and returns UI.
- **Function component:** A JavaScript function that is passed properties and
  uses hooks to manage state and perform side effects, as well as returning UI.
- **Class component:** A JavaScript class that includes a render method that
  returns UI. It may also set up state in its constructor function and manage
  state and perform side effects in its life-cycle methods.

**Component side effects:** React components generally transform state into UI.
When component code performs actions outside this main focus—perhaps fetching
data like blog posts or stock prices from the network, setting up a subscription
to an online service, or directly interacting with the DOM to focus form fields
or measure element dimensions—we describe those actions as component _side
effects_.

We want our app and its components to behave predictably, so should make sure
any necessary side effects are deliberate and visible.

### What's new in React

The words starting with _use_—`useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`,
`useEffect`, and `useTransition`—are examples of _React Hooks_. They are
functions that you can call from React function components and that hook into
key React functionality: state, life cycle, and context.

### React Hooks can add state to function components

The state could be local to a component, raised to a component higher in the
tree, and shared among siblings via properties, or global and accessed via
React’s Context mechanism or higher-order components (functions that take a
component as an argument and return a new component that wraps the passed-in
component but that has extra functionality).

#### Stateful function components: Less code, better organization

In JavaScript, functions can contain other functions, so the component can
contain event handlers that react to user interactions with the UI.

Here are some of the results of using the new function component approach rather
than the older class-based approach:

- Less code
- Better code organization with related code kept together along with any
  cleanup code
- Extraction of features to external functions that can be reused and shared
- More easily testable components
- No need to call `super()` in a class constructor
- No need to work with `this` and bind handlers
- Simpler life-cycle model
- Local state in scope for handlers, side effect functions, and the returned UI

With class components, state was set up in the constructor function, event
handlers were bound to `this`, and side-effect code was split across multiple
life-cycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`,
`componentWillUpdate`, and so on).

<Figure src="/media/react-class-component-function-component.png">
  A class component with code spread across life-cycle methods, and a function
  component with the same functionality but with less, better organized code.
</Figure>

Function components with hooks no longer need all the life-cycle methods because
effects can be encapsulated into hooks.

In fact, keeping a feature or effect’s code in one place makes it much easier to
extract into an external function of its own.

#### Custom hooks: Easier code reuse

Function components with hooks encourage you to keep related side-effect logic
in one place. If the side effect is a feature that many components will need,
you can take the organization a step further and extract the code into its own
external function; you can create what is called a _custom hook_.

<Figure src="/media/react-extract-code-into-custom-hooks.png">
  The code for fetching question data and for subscribing to a user service can
  be extracted into custom hooks. The accompanying state can also be managed by
  the hooks.
</Figure>

<Figure src="/media/react-hooks-quiz-and-chat.png">

You can extract code into custom hooks for reuse and sharing. The `Quiz`
component calls both the `useUsers` and `useFetch` hooks. The `Chat` component
calls the `useUsers` hook.

</Figure>

Each custom hook can maintain its own state, whatever it needs to perform its
duties. And because hooks are just functions, if components need access to any
of the hook’s state, the hook can include the state in its return value.

#### Third-party hooks provide ready-made, well-tested functionality

Third-party libraries that work with React have been quick to release new
versions that make the most of hooks’ simpler API and more direct methods of
integration. We take a very brief look at three examples in this section:

- React Router for page navigation
- Redux as an application data store
- React Spring for animation

##### React Router

_React Router_ provides components to help developers manage navigation between
pages in their apps. Its custom hooks make it easy to access common objects
involved in navigation: `useHistory`, `useLocation`, `useParams`, and
`useRouteMatch`. For example, useParams gives access to any parameters matched
in a page’s URL:

```text
URL:    /quiz/:title/:qnum
Code:   const { title, qnum } = useParams()
```

##### Redux

For some applications, a separate store for state might be appropriate. Redux is
a popular library for creating such stores and it is often combined with React
via the React Redux library. Since version 7.1, React Redux offers hooks to make
interacting with the store easier: `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and `useStore`.
For example, `useDispatch` lets you dispatch an action to update the state in
the store. Say you have an application to build question sets for quizzes and
you want to add a question:

```js
const dispatch = useDispatch()
dispatch({ type: "add question", payload: /* question data */ })
```

The new custom hooks remove some of the boilerplate code that was associated
with connecting a React application to a Redux store. React also has a built-in
hook, `useReducer`, which might provide a simpler model for dispatching actions
to update state and remove the perceived need for Redux in some cases.

##### React Spring

_React Spring_ is a Spring-based animation library that currently provides five
hooks to access its functionality: `useSpring`, `useSprings`, `useTrail`,
`useTransition`, and `useChain`. For example, to animate between two values, you
can opt for `useSpring`:

```js
const props = useSpring({ opacity: 1, from: { opacity: 0 } })
```

### Better UX with Concurrent Mode and Suspense

A large part of the motivation for the rewrites of React for versions 16 and 17
was to build the architecture to cope with the multiple demands put upon a user
interface as it loads and manipulates data while users continue interacting with
the application. Concurrent Mode is a core piece of that new architecture, and
`Suspense` components fit the new mode naturally.

<Figure src="/media/react-without-concurrent-mode.png">
  Without Concurrent Mode, interactions like keystrokes are blocked by
  long-running updates.
</Figure>

Wouldn’t it be great if the app could prioritize the text box updates and keep
the user experience smooth, pausing and restarting the filtering duties around
the typing? Say hello to Concurrent Mode!

#### Concurrent Mode

With _Concurrent Mode_, React can schedule tasks in a more granular way, pausing
its work building elements, checking for differences, and updating the DOM for
previous state changes to make sure it responds to user interactions, for
example. In the preceding filtering app example, React can pause rendering of
the filtered list to make sure the text that the user is typing appears in the
text box.

The new React architecture breaks its tasks into smaller units of work,
providing regular points for the browser or operating system to inform the
application that a user is trying to interact with it. React’s scheduler can
then decide what jobs to do based on the priority of each. Reconciling and
committing changes to one part of the component tree can be paused or abandoned
to make sure components with higher priority are updated first.

<Figure src="/media/react-with-concurrent-mode.png">
  In Concurrent Mode, React can pause longer-running updates to quickly react to
  user interactions.
</Figure>

It’s not just user interactions that can benefit from this intelligent
scheduling; responses to incoming data, lazily loaded components or media, or
other asynchronous processes can also enjoy a smoother user-interface upgrade.
React can continue to display a fully interactive existing UI (rather than a
spinner) while it renders the UI for updated state in memory, switching to the
new UI when enough of it is ready. Concurrent Mode enables a couple of new
hooks, `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`, that improve the user experience,
smoothing the change from one view to another or one state to another. It also
goes hand in hand with `Suspense`, both a component for rendering fallback
content and a mechanism for specifying that a component is waiting for
something, like loading data.

#### Suspense

As you have seen, React applications are built from components in a hierarchical
tree. To display the current state of your app onscreen (using the DOM, for
instance), React traverses your components and creates _element trees_,
descriptions of the intended UI, in memory. It compares the latest tree with the
previous one and intelligently decides what DOM updates need to be made to
realize the intended UI. Concurrent mode lets React pause processing of parts of
the element tree, either to work on higher-priority tasks or because the current
component isn’t ready to be processed.

Components built to work with `Suspense` can now _suspend_ if they are not ready
to return their UI (remember, components are either functions or have a render
method and convert properties and state into UI). They might be waiting for
component code or assets or data to load and just don’t yet have the information
they need to fully describe their UI. React can pause processing of a suspended
component and carry on traversing the element tree.

In addition to specifying a mechanism for components to suspend, React provides
a `Suspense` component that you can use to plug holes that suspended components
have left in your user interface. Wrap sections of your UI in `Suspense`
components and use their `fallback` properties to let React know what content to
show if one or more of the wrapped components suspends:

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<MySpinner />}>
  <MyFirstComponent />
  <MySecondComponent />
</Suspense>
```

`Suspense` allows the developer to deliberately manage loading states for
multiple components, either showing fallbacks for individual components, groups
of components, or the app as a whole. It provides a mechanism for library
authors to update their APIs to work with the `Suspense` component, so their
asynchronous features can make full use of the loading state management that
`Suspense` provides.

- _Next_—Tracks the master branch of React development
- _Experimental_—Includes experimental APIs and features

## Managing component state with the useState hook

### Setting up the bookings manager app

#### Generating the app skeleton with create-react-app

```shell
npx create-react-app react-hooks-in-action
```

From the `public` folder, remove all but `index.html`. From the `src` folder,
remove all but `App.css`, `App.js`, and `index.js`.

#### Editing the four key files

- `/public/index.html`—The web page that contains the app
- `/src/App.css`—Some styles to organize elements on the page
- `/src/components/App.js`—The root component that contains all the others
- `/src/index.js`—The file that imports the `App` component and renders it to
  the `index.html` page

```html nu fp=public/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Bookings App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

The router shows the appropriate page to the user by matching the URL with a
page component.

```jsx nu fp=src/components/App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom"

import "../App.css"

import { FaCalendarAlt, FaDoorOpen, FaUsers } from "react-icons/fa"

import BookablesPage from "./Bookables/BookablesPage"
import BookingsPage from "./Bookings/BookingsPage"
import UsersPage from "./Users/UsersPage"
import UserPicker from "./Users/UserPicker"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="App">
        <header>
          <nav>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <Link to="/bookings" className="btn btn-header">
                  <FaCalendarAlt />
                  <span>Bookings</span>
                </Link>
              </li>
              <li>
                <Link to="/bookables" className="btn btn-header">
                  <FaDoorOpen />
                  <span>Bookables</span>
                </Link>
              </li>
              <li>
                <Link to="/users" className="btn btn-header">
                  <FaUsers />
                  <span>Users</span>
                </Link>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </nav>
          <UserPicker />
        </header>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/bookings" element={<BookingsPage />} />
          <Route path="/bookables" element={<BookablesPage />} />
          <Route path="/users" element={<UsersPage />} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
```

Notice that there is no `import React from "react"` at the top of the listing.
React components used to need that line so they would work when the JSX in them
was converted into regular JavaScript. But the tools that compile React, like
`create-react-app`, can transform JSX in the latest versions of React without
needing the import statement.

```jsx nu fp=src/index.js
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import App from "./components/App"

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

#### Adding a database file for the application

#### Creating page components and a UserPicker.js file

```jsx fp=src/components/Bookables/BookablesPage.js
export default function BookablesPage() {
  return (
    <main className="bookables-page">
      <p>Bookables!</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

```jsx fp=src/components/Users/UserPicker.js
export default function UserPicker() {
  return (
    <select>
      <option>Users</option>
    </select>
  )
}
```

```shell
npm start
```

### Storing, using, and setting values with useState

#### Assigning new values to variables doesn't update the UI

Just because you change the value of a variable within your component function
doesn’t mean React will notice.

<Figure src="/media/directly-changing-variable-doesn-t-update-ui.png">
  Directly changing a variable in our component code doesn’t update the UI.
</Figure>

#### Calling useState returns a value and an updater function

<Figure src="/media/using-an-updater-function-updates-ui.png">
  Rather than changing a value directly, we call an updater function. The
  updater function changes the value, and React updates the display with the
  recalculated UI from the component.
</Figure>

The `useState` function returns an array with two elements: a value and an
updater function.

If you want to set an initial value for the variable, pass the initial value as
an argument to the `useState` function.

```jsx nu fp=src/components/Bookables/BookablesList.js
import { useState } from "react"
import { bookables } from "../../static.json"

export default function BookablesList() {
  const group = "Rooms"
  const bookablesInGroup = bookables.filter(b => b.group === group)
  const [bookableIndex, setBookableIndex] = useState(1)

  return (
    <ul className="bookables items-list-nav">
      {bookablesInGroup.map((b, i) => (
        <li key={b.id} className={i === bookableIndex ? "selected" : null}>
          <button className="btn" onClick={() => setBookableIndex(i)}>
            {b.title}
          </button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Challenge 2.1:

```jsx nu fp=src/components/Users/UsersList.js
import { useState } from "react"
import { users } from "../../static.json"

export default function UsersList() {
  const [userIndex, setUserIndex] = useState(0)

  return (
    <ul className="users items-list-nav">
      {users.map((u, i) => (
        <li key={u.id} className={i === userIndex ? "selected" : null}>
          <button className="btn" onClick={() => setUserIndex(i)}>
            {u.name}
          </button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

```jsx nu fp=src/components/Users/UsersPage.js
import UsersList from "./UsersList"

export default function UsersPage() {
  return (
    <main className="users-page">
      <UsersList />
    </main>
  )
}
```

Challenge 2.2

```jsx nu fp=src/components/Users/UsersPicker.js
import { users } from "../../static.json"

export default function UserPicker() {
  return (
    <select>
      {users.map(u => (
        <option key={u.id}>{u.name}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  )
}
```

#### Calling the updater function replaces the previous state value

##### The class component approach

React merges the object you passed to `setState` with the existing state.

##### The function component approach

The updater function _replaces_ the previous state value with the value you pass
to the function.

So, if you really need to use an object with the `useState` hook, copy across
all the properties from the old object when you set a new property value:

```jsx
function handleClick(index) {
  setState({
    ...state,
    bookableIndex: index,
  })
}
```

Notice how the spread operator, `...state`, is used in the preceding snippet to
copy all of the properties from the old state to the new. In fact, to ensure
that you have the latest state when setting new values based on old, you can
pass a function as the argument to the updater function, like this:

```jsx
function handleClick(index) {
  setState(state => {
    return {
      ...state,
      bookableIndex: index,
    }
  })
}
```

React will pass in the latest state as the first argument.

#### Passing a function to useState as the initial value

```jsx
function ShinyComponent({ tangledWeb }) {
  const [shiny, setShiny] = useState(untangle(tangledWeb))
  ...
}
```

Whenever `ShinyComponent` runs, maybe in response to setting another piece of
state, the expensive `untangle` function runs as well.

Luckily, the `useStat`e hook accepts a function as its argument, a _lazy initial
state_.

```jsx hl=2
function ShinyComponent({ tangledWeb }) {
  const [shiny, setShiny] = useState(() => untangle(tangledWeb))
  ...
}
```

Use the lazy initial state if you need to undertake expensive work to generate
an initial value for a piece of state.

#### Using the previous state when setting the new state

```jsx nu fp=src/components/Bookables/BookablesList.js hl=3,10..12,15,25..31
import { useState } from "react"
import { bookables } from "../../static.json"
import { FaArrowRight } from "react-icons/fa"

export default function BookablesList() {
  const group = "Rooms"
  const bookablesInGroup = bookables.filter(b => b.group === group)
  const [bookableIndex, setBookableIndex] = useState(1)

  function nextBookable() {
    setBookableIndex(i => (i + 1) % bookablesInGroup.length)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul className="bookables items-list-nav">
        {bookablesInGroup.map((b, i) => (
          <li key={b.id} className={i === bookableIndex ? "selected" : null}>
            <button className="btn" onClick={() => setBookableIndex(i)}>
              {b.title}
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>
        <button className="btn" onClick={nextBookable} autoFocus>
          <FaArrowRight />
          <span>Next</span>
        </button>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

By using hooks to hand over management of our state values to React, we don’t
just ask it to update values and trigger re-renders; we also give it permission
to efficiently schedule when any updates take place. React can intelligently
batch updates together and ignore redundant updates.

When we want to update a state value based on its previous value, as in our Next
button example, instead of passing the updater function a value to set, we can
pass it a function. React will pass that function the current state value and
will use the return value of that function as the new state value. By passing a
function, we ensure that any new values that are based on old values have the
latest information with which to work.
